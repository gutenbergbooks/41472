<p><span class="bold">LIGHTFOOT, JOSEPH BARBER<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (1828-1889), English
theologian and bishop of Durham, was born at Liverpool on the
13th of April 1828. His father was a Liverpool accountant.
He was educated at King Edward&rsquo;s school, Birmingham, under
James Prince Lee, afterwards bishop of Manchester, and had
as contemporaries B. F. Westcott and E. W. Benson. In 1847
Lightfoot went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and there
read for his degree with Westcott. He graduated senior classic
and 30th wrangler, and was elected a fellow of his college.
From 1854 to 1859 he edited the <i>Journal of Classical and Sacred
Philology</i>. In 1857 he became tutor and his fame as a scholar
grew rapidly. He was made Hulsean professor in 1861, and
shortly afterwards chaplain to the Prince Consort and honorary
chaplain in ordinary to the queen. In 1866 he was Whitehall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id="page627"></a>627</span>
preacher, and in 1871 he became canon of St Paul&rsquo;s. His
sermons were not remarkable for eloquence, but a certain
solidity and balance of judgment, an absence of partisanship,
a sobriety of expression combined with clearness and force of
diction, attracted hearers and inspired them with confidence.
As was written of him in <i>The Times</i> after his death, &ldquo;his personal
character carried immense weight, but his great position depended
still more on the universally recognized fact that his belief in
Christian truth and his defence of it were supported by learning
as solid and comprehensive as could be found anywhere in
Europe, and by a temper not only of the utmost candour but
of the highest scientific capacity. The days in which his university
influence was asserted were a time of much shaking of old
beliefs. The disintegrating speculations of an influential school
of criticism in Germany were making their way among English
men of culture just about the time, as is usually the case, when
the tide was turning against them in their own country. The
peculiar service which was rendered at this juncture by the
&lsquo;Cambridge School&rsquo; was that, instead of opposing a mere
dogmatic opposition to the Tübingen critics, they met them
frankly on their own ground; and instead of arguing that their
conclusions ought not to be and could not be true, they simply
proved that their facts and their premisses were wrong. It
was a characteristic of equal importance that Dr Lightfoot,
like Dr Westcott, never discussed these subjects in the mere
spirit of controversy. It was always patent that what he was
chiefly concerned with was the substance and the life of Christian
truth, and that his whole energies were employed in this inquiry
because his whole heart was engaged in the truths and facts
which were at stake. He was not diverted by controversy to
side-issues; and his labour was devoted to the positive elucidation
of the sacred documents in which the Christian truth is
enshrined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1872 the anonymous publication of <i>Supernatural Religion</i>
created considerable sensation. In a series of masterly papers
in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, between December 1874 and May
1877, Lightfoot successfully undertook the defence of the New
Testament canon. The articles were published in collected
form in 1889. About the same time he was engaged in contributions
to W. Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i> and
<i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, and he also joined the committee for
revising the translation of the New Testament. In 1875 he
became Lady Margaret professor of divinity in succession to
William Selwyn. He had previously written his commentaries
on the epistles to the Galatians (1865), Philippians (1868) and
Colossians (1875), the notes to which were distinguished by
sound judgment and enriched from his large store of patristic
and classical learning. These commentaries may be described as
to a certain extent a new departure in New Testament exegesis.
Before Lightfoot&rsquo;s time commentaries, especially on the epistles,
had not infrequently consisted either of short homilies on
particular portions of the text, or of endeavours to enforce
foregone conclusions, or of attempts to decide with infinite
industry and ingenuity between the interpretations of former
commentators. Lightfoot, on the contrary, endeavoured to
make his author interpret himself, and by considering the general
drift of his argument to discover his meaning where it appeared
doubtful. Thus he was able often to recover the meaning of a
passage which had long been buried under a heap of contradictory
glosses, and he founded a school in which sobriety and common
sense were added to the industry and ingenuity of former commentators.
In 1879 Lightfoot was consecrated bishop of
Durham in succession to C. Baring. His moderation, good
sense, wisdom, temper, firmness and erudition made him as
successful in this position as he had been when professor of
theology, and he speedily surrounded himself with a band of
scholarly young men. He endeavoured to combine his habits
of theological study with the practical work of administration.
He exercised a large liberality and did much to further the work
of temperance and purity organizations. He continued to
work at his editions of the <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, and in 1885 published
an edition of the Epistles of Ignatius and Polycarp,
collecting also a large store of valuable materials for a second
edition of Clement of Rome, which was published after his
death (1st ed., 1869). His defence of the authenticity of the
Epistles of Ignatius is one of the most important contributions
to that very difficult controversy. His unremitting labours
impaired his health and shortened his splendid career at Durham.
He was never married. He died at Bournemouth on the 21st
of December 1889, and was succeeded in the episcopate by
Westcott, his schoolfellow and lifelong friend.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGHTHOUSE<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span>, a form of building erected to carry a light for
the purpose of warning or guidance, especially at sea.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Early History.</span>&mdash;The earliest lighthouses, of which records
exist, were the towers built by the Libyans and Cushites in Lower
Egypt, beacon fires being maintained in some of them by the
priests. Lesches, a Greek poet (<i>c.</i> 660 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) mentions a lighthouse
at Sigeum (now Cape Incihisari) in the Troad. This appears
to have been the first light regularly maintained for the guidance
of mariners. The famous Pharos<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of Alexandria, built by
Sostratus of Cnidus in the reign of Ptolemy II. (283-247 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
was regarded as one of the wonders of the world. The tower,
which took its name from that of the small island on which it
was built, is said to have been 600 ft. in height, but the evidence
in support of this statement is doubtful. It was destroyed by
an earthquake in the 13th century, but remains are said to have
been visible as late as 1350. The name Pharos became the
general term for all lighthouses, and the term &ldquo;pharology&rdquo;
has been used for the science of lighthouse construction.</p>

<p>The tower at Ostia was built by the emperor Claudius
(A.D. 50). Other famous Roman lighthouses were those at
Ravenna, Pozzuoli and Messina. The ancient Pharos at Dover
and that at Boulogne, later known as <i>la Tour d&rsquo;Ordre</i>, were
built by the Romans and were probably the earliest lighthouses
erected in western Europe. Both are now demolished.</p>

<p>The light of Cordouan, on a rock in the sea at the mouth of
the Gironde, is the earliest example now existing of a wave-swept
tower. Earlier towers on the same rock are attributed the
first to Louis le Debonnaire (<i>c.</i> A.D. 805) and the second to Edward
the Black Prince. The existing structure was begun in 1584
during the reign of Henri II. of France and completed in 1611.
The upper part of the beautiful Renaissance building was removed
towards the end of the 18th century and replaced by a loftier
cylindrical structure rising to a height of 207 ft. above the rock
and with the focal plane of the light 196 ft. above high water
(fig. 1). Until the 18th century the light exhibited from the
tower was from an oak log fire, and subsequently a coal fire was
in use for many years. The ancient tower at Corunna, known
as the Pillar of Hercules, is supposed to have been a Roman
Pharos. The Torre del Capo at Genoa originally stood on the
promontory of San Berrique. It was built in 1139 and first
used as a lighthouse in 1326. It was rebuilt on its present
site in 1643. This beautiful tower rises 236 ft. above the cliff,
the light being elevated 384 ft. above sea-level. A lens light was
first installed in 1841. The Pharos of Meloria was constructed
by the Pisans in 1154 and was several times rebuilt until
finally destroyed in 1290. On the abandonment of Meloria
by the Pisans, they erected the still existing tower at Leghorn
in 1304.</p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries numerous towers, on which
were erected braziers or grates containing wood or coal fires,
were established in various positions on the coasts of Europe.
Among such stations in the United Kingdom were Tynemouth
(<i>c.</i> 1608), the Isle of May (1636), St Agnes (1680), St Bees (1718)
and the Lizard (1751). The oldest lighthouse in the United
States is believed to be the Boston light situated on Little
Brewster Island on the south side of the main entrance to Boston
Harbour, Mass. It was established in 1716, the present structure
dating from 1859. During the American War of Independence
the lighthouse suffered many vicissitudes and was successively
destroyed and rebuilt three times by the American or British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id="page628"></a>628</span>
forces. At the third rebuilding in 1783 a stone tower 68 ft. in
height was erected, the illuminant consisting of four oil lamps.
Other early lighthouse structures on the New England coast
were those at Beaver Tail, near the entrance to Newport Harbour
(1740), and the Brant at the entrance to Nantucket Harbour
(1754). A watch-house and beacon appear to have been erected
on Beacon or Lighthouse Island as well as on Point Allerton
Hill near Boston, prior to 1673, but these structures would seem
to have been in the nature of look-out stations in time of war
rather than lighthouses for the guidance of mariners.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Lighthouse Structures.</span>&mdash;The structures of lighthouses
may be divided into two classes, (<i>a</i>) those on rocks, shoals or
in other situations exposed to the force of the sea, and (<i>b</i>) the
more numerous class of land structures.</p>

<p><i>Wave-swept Towers.</i>&mdash;In determining the design of a lighthouse
tower to be erected in a wave-swept position consideration must
be given to the physical features of the site and its surroundings.
Towers of this description are classified as follows: (1) Masonry
and concrete structures; (2) Openwork steel and iron-framed
erections on pile or other foundations; (3) Cast iron plated towers;
(4) Structures erected on cylinder foundations.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Masonry Towers.</i>&mdash;Masonry or concrete towers are generally
preferred for erection on wave-swept rocks affording good
foundation, and have also been constructed in other situations
where adequate foundations have been made by sinking caissons
into a soft sea bed. Smeaton&rsquo;s tower on the Eddystone Rock is
the model upon which most later designs of masonry towers have
been based, although many improvements in detail have since
been made. In situations of great exposure the following
requirements in design should be observed: (<i>a</i>) The centre
of gravity of the tower structure should be as low as possible.
(<i>b</i>) The mass of the structure superimposed at any horizontal
section must be sufficient to prevent its displacement by the
combined forces of wind and waves without dependence on the
adhesion at horizontal joint faces or on the dovetailing of stones
introduced as an additional safeguard. (<i>c</i>) The structure should
be circular in plan throughout, this form affording the least
resistance to wave stroke and wind pressure in any direction.
(<i>d</i>) The lower portion of the tower exposed to the direct horizontal
stroke of the waves should, for preference, be constructed with
vertical face. The upper portion to be either straight with
uniform batter or continuously curved in the vertical plane.
External projections from the face of the tower, except in the
case of a gallery under the lantern, should be avoided, the surface
throughout being smooth. (<i>e</i>) The height from sea-level to the
top of the tower should be sufficient to avoid the obscuration
of the light by broken water or dense spray driving over the
lantern. (<i>f</i>) The foundation of the tower should be carried
well into the solid rock. (<i>g</i>) The materials of which the tower
is built should be of high density and of resistant nature. (<i>h</i>)
The stones used in the construction of the tower, at any rate
those on the outer face, should be dovetailed or joggled one to
the other in order to prevent their being dislodged by the sea
during the process of construction and as an additional safeguard
of stability. Of late years, cement concrete has been used
to a considerable extent for maritime structures, including
lighthouses, either alone or faced with masonry.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Openwork Structures.</i>&mdash;Many examples of openwork steel
and iron lighthouses exist. Some typical examples are described
hereafter. This form of design is suitable for situations where
the tower has to be carried on a foundation of iron or steel
piles driven or screwed into an insecure or sandy bottom, such
as on shoals, coral reefs and sand banks or in places where other
materials of construction are exceptionally costly and where
facility of erection is a desideratum.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Cast iron Towers.</i>&mdash;Cast iron plated towers have been
erected in many situations where the cost of stone or scarcity
of labour would have made the erection of a masonry tower
excessively expensive.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Caisson Foundations.</i>&mdash;Cylinder or caisson foundations
have been used for lighthouse towers in numerous cases where
such structures have been erected on sand banks or shoals.
A remarkable instance is the Rothersand Tower. Two attempts
have been made to sink a caisson in the outer Diamond Shoal
off Cape Hatteras on the Atlantic coast of the United States,
but these have proved futile.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following are brief descriptions of the more important wave-swept
towers in various parts of the world.</p>

<p><i>Eddystone</i> (<i>Winstanley&rsquo;s Tower</i>).&mdash;The Eddystone rocks, which lie
about 14 m. off Plymouth, are fully exposed to south-west seas.
The reef is submerged at high water of spring tides. Four towers
have been constructed on the reef. The first lighthouse (fig. 2) was
polygonal in plan and highly ornamented with galleries and projections
which offered considerable resistance to the sea stroke.
The work was begun by Henry Winstanley, a gentleman of Essex,
in 1695. In 1698 it was finished to a height of 80 ft. to the wind
vane and the light exhibited, but in the following year, in consequence
of damage by storms, the tower was increased in diameter
from 16 ft. to 24 ft. by the addition of an outer ring of masonry and
made solid to a height of 20 ft. above the rock, the tower being
raised to nearly 120 ft. The work was completed in the year 1700.
The lower part of the structure appears to have been of stone, the
upper part and lantern of timber. During the great storm of the
20th of November 1703 the tower was swept away, those in it at the
time, including the builder, being drowned.</p>

<p><i>Eddystone</i> (<i>Rudyerd&rsquo;s Tower</i>, fig. 3).&mdash;This structure was begun in
1706 and completed in 1709. It was a frustum of a cone 22 ft. 8 in.
in diameter at the base and 14 ft. 3 in. at the top. The tower was
92 ft. in height to the top of the lantern. The work consisted
principally of oak timbers securely bolted and cramped together, the
lower part being filled in solid with stone to add weight to the
structure. The simplicity of the design and the absence of projections
from the outer face rendered the tower very suitable to
withstand the onslaught of the waves. The lighthouse was destroyed
by fire in 1755.</p>

<p><i>Eddystone</i> (<i>Smeaton&rsquo;s Tower</i>, fig. 4).&mdash;This famous work, which
consisted entirely of stone, was begun in 1756, the light being first
exhibited in 1759. John Smeaton was the first engineer to use
dovetailed joints for the stones in a lighthouse structure. The stones,
which averaged 1 ton in weight, were fastened to each other by
means of dovetailed vertical joint faces, oak key wedges, and by
oak tree-nails wedged top and bottom, extending vertically from
every course into the stones beneath it. During the 19th century
the tower was strengthened on two occasions by the addition of
heavy wrought iron ties, and the overhanging cornice was reduced
in diameter to prevent the waves from lifting the stones from their
beds. In 1877, owing partly to the undermining of the rock on
which the tower was built and the insufficient height of the structure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629"></a>629</span>
the Corporation of Trinity House determined on the erection of a
new lighthouse in place of Smeaton&rsquo;s tower.</p>

<p><i>Eddystone, New Lighthouse</i> (<i>J. N. Douglass</i>).&mdash;The site selected
for the new tower is 120 ft. S.S.E. from Smeaton&rsquo;s lighthouse, where
a suitable foundation was found, although a considerable section
of the lower courses had to be laid below the level of low water.
The vertical base is 44 ft. in diameter and 22 ft. in height. The
tower (figs. 5 and 6) is a concave elliptic frustum, and is solid, with
the exception of a fresh-water tank, to a height of 25 ft. 6 in. above
high-water level. The walls above this level vary in thickness
from 8 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. 3 in. under the gallery. All the stones are
dovetailed, both horizontally and vertically, on all joint faces, the
stones of the foundation course being secured to the rock by Muntz
metal bolts. The tower contains 62,133 cub. ft. of granite, weighing
4668 tons. The height of the structure from low water ordinary
spring tides to the mean focal plane is 149 ft. and it stands 133 ft.
above high water. The lantern is a cylindrical helically framed
structure with domed roof. The astragals are of gun-metal and the
pedestal of cast iron. The optical apparatus consists of two superposed
tiers of refracting lens panels, 12 in each tier of 920 mm. focal
distance. The lenses subtend an angle of 92° vertically. The 12
lens panels are arranged in groups of two, thus producing a group
flashing light showing 2 flashes of 1½ seconds&rsquo; duration every half
minute, the apparatus revolving once in 3 minutes. The burners
originally fitted in the apparatus were of 6-wick pattern, but these
were replaced in 1904 by incandescent oil vapour burners. The
intensity of the combined beam of light from the two apparatus is
292,000 candles. At the time of the completion of the lighthouse
two bells, weighing 2 tons each and struck by mechanical power,
were installed for fog-signalling purposes. Since that date an
explosive gun-cotton fog signal has been erected, the bells being
removed. At a lower level in the tower are installed 2 21-in. parabolic
silvered reflectors with 2-wick burners, throwing a fixed light
of 8000 candle-power over a danger known
as the Hand Deeps. The work of preparing
the foundation was begun on the
17th of July 1878, the foundation stone
being laid by the late duke of Edinburgh
on the 19th of August 1879. The last
stone was laid on the 1st of June 1881,
and the light was exhibited for the first
time on the 18th of May 1882. The upper
portion of Smeaton&rsquo;s tower, which was
removed on completion of the new lighthouse,
was re-erected on Plymouth Hoe,
where it replaced the old Trinity House
sea mark. One of the principal features
in the design of the new Eddystone
lighthouse tower is the solid vertical
base. This construction was much criticized
at the time, but experience has
proved that heavy seas striking the
massive cylindrical structure are immediately
broken up and rush round to the
opposite side, spray alone ascending to
the height of the lantern gallery. On the
other hand, the waves striking the old
tower at its foundation ran up the surface,
which presented a curved face to the
waves, and, unimpeded by any projection
until arriving at the lantern gallery, were
partially broken up by the cornice and
then spent themselves in heavy spray
over the lantern. The shock to which
the cornice of the gallery was exposed
was so great that stones were sometimes
lifted from their beds. The new Eddystone
tower presents another point of
dissimilarity from Smeaton&rsquo;s structure,
in that the stones forming the floors consist of single corbels built
into the wall and constituting solid portions thereof. In Smeaton&rsquo;s
tower the floors consisted of stone arches, the thrust being taken
by the walls of the tower itself, which were strengthened for the
purpose by building in chains in the form of hoops (fig. 7). The
system of constructing corbelled stone floors was first adopted by
R. Stevenson in the Bell Rock lighthouse (fig. 8).</p>

<p><i>Bell Rock Lighthouse</i> (fig. 9).&mdash;The Bell Rock, which lies 12 m.
off the coast of Forfarshire, is exposed to a considerable extent at
low water. The tower is submerged to a depth of about 16 ft. at
high water of spring tides. The rock is of hard sandstone. The
lighthouse was constructed by Robert Stevenson and is 100 ft. in
height, the solid portion being carried to a height of 21 ft. above
high water. The work of construction was begun in 1807, and
finished in 1810, the light being first exhibited in 1811. The total
weight of the tower is 2076 tons. A new lantern and dioptric
apparatus were erected on the tower in 1902. The focal plane of
the light is elevated 93 ft. above high water.</p>

<p><i>Bishop Rock Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The lighthouse on the Bishop Rock,
which is the westernmost landfall rock of the Scilly Islands, occupies
perhaps a more exposed situation than any other in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page630" id="page630"></a>630</span>
The first lighthouse erected there was begun in 1847 under the
direction of N. Douglass. The tower consisted of a cast and wrought
iron openwork structure having the columns deeply sunk into the
rock. On the 5th of February 1850, when the tower was ready for
the erection of the lantern and illuminating apparatus, a heavy
storm swept away the whole of the structure. This tower was designed
for an elevation of 94 ft. to the focal plane. In 1851 the
erection of a granite tower, from the designs of James Walker, was
begun; the light was first exhibited in 1858. The tower (fig. 11)
had an elevation to the focal plane of 110 ft., the lower 14 courses
being arranged in steps, or offsets, to break up the force of the waves.
This structure also proved insufficient to withstand the very heavy
seas to which it was exposed. Soon after its completion the 5-cwt.
fog bell, fixed to the lantern gallery 100 ft. above high-water mark,
was washed away, together with the flagstaff and ladder. The
tower vibrated considerably during storms, and it was found that
some of the external blocks of granite had been split by the excessive
stress to which they had been exposed. In 1874 the tower was
strengthened by bolting continuous iron ties to the internal surfaces
of the walls. In 1881, when further signs of damage appeared, it
was determined to remove the upper storey or service room of the
lighthouse, and to case the structure from its base upwards with
granite blocks securely dovetailed to each other and to the existing
work. At the same time it was considered advisable to increase the
elevation of the light, and place the mean focal plane of the new
apparatus at an elevation of 146 ft. above high-water mark. The
work was begun in 1883, and the new apparatus was first illuminated
on the 25th of October 1887. During the operation of heightening
the tower it was necessary to install a temporary light, consisting
of a cylindrical lightship lantern with catoptric apparatus; this was
raised from time to time in advance of the structure as the work
proceeded. The additional masonry built into the tower amounts
approximately to 3220 tons. Profiting by the experience gained
after the construction of the new Eddystone tower, Sir J. N. Douglass
decided to build the lower portion of the improved Bishop Rock
tower in the form of a cylinder, but with considerably increased
elevation (figs. 12 and 13). The cylindrical base is 40 ft. in diameter,
and rises to 25 ft. above high-water mark. The lantern is cylindrical
and helically framed, 14 ft. in diameter, the glazing being 15 ft. in
height. The optical apparatus consists of two superposed tiers of
lenses of 1330 mm. focal distance, the lenses subtending a horizontal
angle of 36° and a vertical angle of 80°. The apparatus consists of
5 groups of lenses each group producing a double flashing light of one
minute period, the whole apparatus revolving once in five minutes.
The maximum aggregate candle-power of the flash is 622,000 candles.
A gun-cotton explosive fog signal is attached to the lantern. The cost
of the various lighthouses on the Bishop Rock has been as follows:</p>

<p><i>The Smalls Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;A lighthouse has existed on the Smalls
rock, 18½ m. off Milford Haven, since 1776, when an oak pile structure
was erected by Henry Whiteside. The existing structure, after the
model of the second lighthouse on the Bishop Rock, was erected in
1856-1861 by the Trinity House and is 114 ft. in height from the
foundation to the lantern floor. A new optical apparatus was installed
in 1907.</p>

<p><i>Minot&rsquo;s Ledge Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The tower, which is 89 ft. in height,
is built of granite upon a reef off Boston Harbor, Mass., and occupied
five years in construction, being completed in 1860 at a cost of £62,500.
The rock just bares at low water. The stones are dovetailed vertically
but not on their horizontal beds in
the case of the lower 40 ft. or solid
portion of the tower, bonding bolts being
substituted for the horizontal dovetailed
joints used in the case of the Wolf and
other English towers. The shape of the
tower is a conical frustum.</p>

<p><i>Wolf Rock Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;This much
exposed rock lies midway between the
Scilly Isles and the Lizard Point, and is
submerged to the depth of about 6 ft. at
high water. The tower was erected in
1862-1869 (fig. 14). It is 116 ft. 6 in. high,
41 ft. 8 in. diameter at the base, decreasing
to 17 ft. at the top. The walls are
7 ft. 9½ in. thick, decreasing to 2 ft. 3 in.
The shaft is a concave elliptic frustum,
and contains 3296 tons. The lower part
of the tower has projecting scarcements
in order to break up the sea.</p>

<p><i>Dhu Heartach Rock Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The
Dhu Heartach Rock, 35 ft. above high
water, is 14 m. from the island of Mull,
which is the nearest shore. The maximum
diameter of the tower (fig. 15), which
is of parabolic outline, is 36 ft., decreasing
to 16 ft.; the shaft is solid for 32 ft.
above the rock; the masonry weighs
3115 tons, of which 1810 are contained
in the solid part. This tower occupied
six years in erection, and was completed
in 1872.</p>

<p><i>Great Basses Lighthouse, Ceylon.</i>&mdash;The
Great Basses lighthouse lies 6 m. from
the nearest land. The cylindrical base is
32 ft. in diameter, above which is a tower 67 ft. 5 in. high and 23 ft.
in diameter. The walls vary in thickness from 5 ft. to 2 ft. The
tower, including the base, contains about 2768 tons. The work was
finished in three years, 1870-1873.</p>

<p><i>Spectacle Reef Lighthouse, Lake Huron.</i>&mdash;This is a structure similar
to that on Minot&rsquo;s ledge, standing on a limestone reef at the northern
end of the lake. The tower (fig. 16) was constructed with a view to
withstanding the effects of ice massing in solid fields thousands of
acres in extent and travelling at considerable velocity. The tower is
in shape the frustum of a cone, 32 ft. in diameter at the base and 93
ft. in height to the coping of the gallery. The focal plane is at a level
of 97 ft. above the base. The lower 34 ft. of the tower is solid.
The work was completed in 1874, having occupied four years. The
cost amounted to approximately £78,000.</p>

<p><i>Chicken Rock Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The Chicken Rock lies 1 m. off the Calf
of Man. The curve of the tower, which is 123 ft. 4 in. high, is hyperbolic,
the diameter varying from 42 ft. to 16 ft. The tower is submerged
5 ft. at high-water springs. The solid part is 32 ft. 6 in. in
height, weighing 2050 tons, the whole weight of the tower being
3557 tons. The walls decrease from 9 ft. 3 in. to 2 ft. 3 in. in thickness.
The work was begun in 1869 and completed in 1874.</p>

<p><i>Ar&rsquo;men Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The masonry tower, erected by the French
Lighthouse Service, on the Ar&rsquo;men Rock off the western extremity
of the Île de Sein, Finistère, occupied fifteen years in construction
(1867-1881). The rock is of small area, barely uncovered at low
water, and it was therefore found impossible to construct a tower
having a base diameter greater than 24 ft. The focal plane of the
light is 94 ft. above high water (fig. 17).</p>

<p><i>St George&rsquo;s Reef Lighthouse, California.</i>&mdash;This structure consists of
a square pyramidal stone tower rising from the easterly end of an
oval masonry pier, built on a rock to a height of 60 ft. above the
water. The focal plane is at an elevation of 146 ft. above high water.
The site is an exceedingly dangerous one, and the work, which was
completed in 1891, cost approximately £144,000.</p>

<p><i>Rattray Head Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;This lighthouse was constructed
between the years 1892 and 1895 by the Northern Lighthouse Commissioners
upon the Ron Rock, lying about one-fifth of a mile off
Rattray Head, Aberdeenshire. The focal plane is 91 ft. above high
water, the building being approximately 113 ft. in height. In the
tower there is a fog-horn worked by compressed air.</p>

<p><i>Fastnet Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;In the year 1895 it was reported to the Irish
Lights Commissioners that the then existing lighthouse on the Fastnet
Rock off the south-west coast of Ireland, which was completed
in 1854 and consisted of a circular cast iron tower 86 ft. in height
on the summit of the rock, was considerably undermined. It was
subsequently determined to proceed with the erection of a granite
structure of increased height and founded upon a sound ledge of
rock on one side of the higher, but now considerably undermined.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631"></a>631</span>
portion of the reef. This lighthouse tower has its foundation laid
near high-water level. The focal plane is at a level of 158 ft. above
high-water mark. The cost of the structure, which was commenced
in 1899 and completed in 1904, was £79,000.</p>

<p><i>Beachy Head Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;A lighthouse has been erected upon the
foreshore at the foot of Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, to replace
the old structure on the cliff having an elevation of 284 ft. above high-water
mark. Experience proved that the light of the latter was
frequently obscured by banks of mist or fog, while at the lower level
the transparency of the atmosphere was considerably less impaired.
The Trinity House therefore decided in the year 1899 to proceed
with the construction of a granite tower upon the foreshore at a
distance of some 570 ft. from the base of the cliff (fig. 18). The
foreshore at this point consists of chalk, and the selected site just
bares at low water ordinary spring tides. The foundation course was
laid at a depth of 10 ft. below the surface, the area being excavated
within a coffer-dam. The tower, which is 47 ft. in diameter at the
base, has an elevation to the focal plane above high water of 103 ft.,
or a total height from foundation course to gallery coping of 123 ft.
6 in. The lower or solid portion of the tower has its face stones
constructed in vertical offsets or steps in a similar manner to that
adopted at the Wolf Rock and elsewhere. The tower is constructed
with a facing of granite, all the stones being dovetailed in the usual
manner. The hearting of the base is largely composed of concrete.
The work was completed in 1902 and cost £56,000.</p>

<p><i>Maplin Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;The screw pile lighthouse erected on the
Maplin Sand in the estuary of the river Thames in 1838 is the earliest
of its kind and served as a model for numerous similar structures
in various parts of the world. The piles are nine in number, 5 in.
diameter of solid wrought iron with screws 4 ft. diameter (fig. 19).</p>

<p><i>Fowey Rocks Lighthouse, Florida.</i>&mdash;This iron structure, which was
begun in 1875 and completed in 1878, stands on the extreme northern
point of the Florida reefs. The height of the tower, which is founded
on wrought iron piles driven 10 ft. into the coral rock, is 110 ft. from
high water to focal plane. The iron openwork pyramidal structure
encloses a plated iron dwelling for the accommodation of the keepers.
The cost of construction amounted to £32,600.</p>

<p><i>Alligator Reef Lighthouse, Florida.</i>&mdash;This tower is one of the finest
iron sea-swept lighthouse structures in the world. It consists of a
pyramidal iron framework 135 ft. 6 in. in height, standing on the
Florida Reef in 5 ft. of water. The cost of the structure, which is
similar to the Fowey Rocks tower, was £37,000.</p>

<p><i>American Shoal Lighthouse, Florida.</i>&mdash;This tower (fig. 20) is typical
of the openwork pile structures on the Florida reefs, and was completed
in 1880. The focal plane of the light is at an elevation of
109 ft. above high water.</p>

<p><i>Wolf Trap Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;This building was erected during the years
1893 and 1894 on Wolf Trap Spit in Chesapeake Bay, near the site
of the old openwork structure which was swept away by ice early in
1893. The new tower is formed upon a cast iron caisson 30 ft. in
diameter sunk 18 ft. into the sandy bottom. The depth of water on
the shoal is 16 ft. at low water. The caisson was filled with concrete,
and is surmounted by a brick superstructure 52 ft. in height from
low water to the focal plane of the light. A somewhat similar
structure was erected in 1885-1887 on the Fourteen Foot Bank in
Delaware Bay, at a cost of £24,700. The foundation in this case
was, however, shifting sand, and the caisson was carried to a greater
depth.</p>

<p><i>Rothersand Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;This lighthouse, off the entrance to the
river Weser (Germany), is a structure of great interest on account
of the difficulties met with in its construction. The tower had to be
founded on a bottom of shifting sand 20 ft. below low water and in
a very exposed situation. Work was begun in May 1881, when
attempts were made to sink an iron caisson under pneumatic pressure.
Owing to the enormous scour removing the sand from one side of the
caisson it tilted to an alarming angle, but eventually it was sunk to a
level of 70 ft. below low-water mark. In October of the same year
the whole structure collapsed. Another attempt, made in May 1883,
to sink a caisson of bi-convex shape in plan 47 ft. long, 37 ft. wide
and 62 ft. in height, met with success, and after many difficulties the
structure was sunk to a depth of 73 ft. below low water, the sides
being raised by the addition of iron plating as the caisson sank.
The sand was removed from the interior by suction. Around the
caisson foundation were placed 74,000 cub. yds. of mattress work
and stones, the interior being filled with concrete. Towards the end
of 1885 the lighthouse was completed, at a total cost, including the
first attempt, of over £65,000. The tower is an iron structure in the
shape of a concave elliptic frustum, its base being founded upon the
caisson foundation at about half-tide level (fig. 21). The light is
electric, the current being supplied by cable from the shore. The
focal plane is 78 ft. above high water or 109 ft. from the sand level.
The total height from the foundation of the caisson to the top of the
vane is 185 ft.</p>

<p>Other famous wave-swept towers are those at Haulbowline Rock
(Carlingford Lough, Ireland, 1823); Horsburgh (Singapore, 1851);
Bayes d&rsquo;Olonne (Bay of Biscay, 1861); Hanois (Alderney, 1862);
Daedalus Reef, iron tower (Red Sea, 1863); Alguada Reef (Bay of
Bengal, 1865); Longships (Land&rsquo;s End, 1872); the Prongs (Bombay,
1874); Little Basses (Ceylon, 1878); the Graves (Boston, U.S.A.,
1905); Jument d&rsquo;Ouessant (France, 1907); and Roche Bonne
(France, building 1910).</p>

<p><i>Jointing of Stones in Rock Towers.</i>&mdash;Various methods of jointing
the stones in rock towers are shown in figs. 6 and 22. The great
distinction between the towers built by successive engineers
to the Trinity House and other rock lighthouses is that, in the
former the stones of each course are dovetailed together both
laterally and vertically and are not connected by metal or wooden
pins and wedges and dowled as in most other cases. This dovetail
method was first adopted at the Hanois Rock at the suggestion
of Nicholas Douglass. On the upper face, one side and at
one end of each block is a dovetailed projection. On the under
face and the other side and end, corresponding dovetailed
recesses are formed with just sufficient clearance for the raised
bands to enter in setting (fig. 23). The cement mortar in the
joint formed between the faces so locks the dovetails that the
stones cannot be separated without breaking (fig. 24).</p>

<p><i>Effect of Waves</i>.&mdash;The wave stroke to which rock lighthouse
towers are exposed is often considerable. At the Dhu Heartach,
during the erection of the tower, 14 joggled stones, each of 2
tons weight, were washed away after having been set in cement
at a height of 37 ft. above high water, and similar damage
was done during the construction of the Bell Rock tower. The
effect of waves on the Bishop Rock and Eddystone towers has
been noted above.</p>

<p><i>Land Structures for Lighthouses</i>.&mdash;The erection of lighthouse
towers and other buildings on land presents no difficulties of
construction, and such buildings are of ordinary architectural
character. It will therefore be unnecessary to refer to them
in detail. Attention is directed to the Phare d&rsquo;Eckmühl at
Penmarc&rsquo;h (Finistère), completed in 1897. The cost of this
magnificent structure, 207 ft. in height from the ground, was
largely defrayed by a bequest of £12,000 left by the marquis
de Blocqueville. It is constructed entirely of granite, and is
octagonal in plan. The total cost of the tower and other lighthouse
buildings amounted to £16,000.</p>

<p>The tower at Île Vierge (Finistère), completed in 1902, has
an elevation of 247 ft. from the ground level to the focal plane,
and is probably the highest structure of its kind in the world.</p>

<p>The brick tower, constructed at Spurn Point, at the entrance
to the Humber and completed in 1895, replaced an earlier
structure erected by Smeaton at the end of the 18th
century. The existing tower is constructed on a foundation
consisting of concrete cylinders sunk in the shingle beach.
The focal plane of the light is elevated 120 ft. above high water.</p>

<p>Besides being built of stone or brick, land towers are frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id="page633"></a>633</span>
constructed of cast iron plates or open steel-work with a view
to economy. Fine examples of the former are to be found in
many British colonies and elsewhere, that on Dassen Island
(Cape of Good Hope), 105 ft. in height to the focal plane, being
typical (fig. 25). Many openwork structures up to 200 ft. in
height have been built. Recent examples are the towers erected
at Cape San Thomé (Brazil) in 1882, 148 ft. in height (fig. 26),
Mocha (Red Sea) in 1903, 180 ft. and Sanganeb Reef (Red Sea)
1906, 165 ft. in height to the focal plane.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Optical Apparatus</span>.&mdash;Optical apparatus in lighthouses
is required for one or other of three distinct purposes: (1) the
concentration of the rays derived from the light source into a
belt of light distributed evenly around the horizon, condensation
in the vertical plane only being employed; (2) the concentration
of the rays both vertically and horizontally into a pencil or cone
of small angle directed
towards the horizon and
caused to revolve about
the light source as a
centre, thus producing
a flashing light; and (3)
the condensation of the
light in the vertical
plane and also in the
horizontal plane in such
a manner as to concentrate
the rays over a
limited azimuth only.</p>

<p>Apparatus falling
under the first category
produce a fixed light,
and further distinction
can be provided in this
class by mechanical
means of occultation,
resulting in the production
of an occulting
or intermittent light.
Apparatus included in
the second class are
usually employed to
produce flashing lights,
but sometimes the dual
condensation is taken
advantage of to produce
a fixed pencil of rays
thrown towards the
horizon for the purpose
of marking an isolated danger or the limits of a narrow
channel. Such lights are best described by the French term
<i>feux de direction</i>. Catoptric apparatus, by which dual condensation
is produced, are moreover sometimes used for fixed
lights, the light pencils overlapping each other in azimuth.
Apparatus of the third class are employed for sector lights or
those throwing a beam of light over a wider azimuth than can
be conveniently covered by an apparatus of the second class,
and for reinforcing the beam of light emergent from a fixed
apparatus in any required direction.</p>

<p>The above classification of apparatus depends on the resultant
effect of the optical elements. Another classification divides
the instruments themselves into three classes: (<i>a</i>) catoptric,
(<i>b</i>) dioptric and (<i>c</i>) catadioptric.</p>

<p><i>Catoptric</i> apparatus are those by which the light rays are
reflected only from the faces of incidence, such as silvered mirrors
of plane, spherical, parabolic or other profile. <i>Dioptric</i> elements
are those in which the light rays pass through the optical glass,
suffering refraction at the incident and emergent faces (fig. 27).
<i>Catadioptric</i> elements are combined of the two foregoing and
consist of optical prisms in which the light rays suffer refraction
at the incident face, total internal reflexion at a second face
and again refraction on emergence at the third face (fig. 28).</p>

<p>The object of these several forms of optical apparatus is not
only to produce characteristics or distinctions in lights to enable
them to be readily recognized by mariners, but to utilize the
light rays in directions above and below the horizontal plane,
and also, in the case of revolving or flashing lights, in azimuths
not requiring to be illuminated for strengthening the beam in
the direction of the mariner. It will be seen that the effective
condensation in flashing lights is very much greater than in
fixed belts, thus
enabling higher intensities
to be obtained
by the use
of flashing lights
than with fixed apparatus.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Catoptric System</i>.&mdash;Parabolic
reflectors,
consisting of small
facets of silvered
glass set in plaster of
Paris, were first used
about the year 1763
in some of the Mersey
lights by Mr Hutchinson,
then dock
master at Liverpool
(fig. 29). Spherical
metallic reflectors
were introduced in
France in 1781,
followed by parabolic
reflectors on silvered
copper in 1790 in
England and France,
and in Scotland in
1803. The earlier
lights were of fixed
type, a number of reflectors
being arranged
on a frame or
stand in such a
manner that the
pencils of emergent
rays overlapped and
thus illuminated the
whole horizon continuously.
In 1783
the first revolving
light was erected at
Marstrand in Sweden.
Similar apparatus
were installed at Cordouan
(1790), Flamborough
Head (1806)
and at the Bell Rock
(1811). To produce
a revolving or flashing
light the reflectors
were fixed on a revolving
carriage having
several faces.
Three or more reflectors
in a face were
set with their axes
parallel.</p>

<p>A type of parabolic reflector now in use is shown in fig. 30. The
sizes in general use vary from 21 in. to 24 in. diameter. These
instruments are still largely used for light-vessel illumination, and
a few important land lights are at the present time of catoptric type,
including those at St Agnes (Scilly Islands), Cromer and St Anthony
(Falmouth).</p>

<p><i>Dioptric System</i>.&mdash;The first adaptation of dioptric lenses to lighthouses
is probably due to T. Rogers, who used lenses at one of the
Portland lighthouses between 1786 and 1790. Subsequently lenses
by the same maker were used at Howth, Waterford and the North
Foreland. Count Buffon had in 1748 proposed to grind out of a solid
piece of glass a lens in steps or concentric zones in order to reduce
the thickness to a minimum (fig. 31). Condorcet in 1773 and Sir
D. Brewster in 1811 designed built-up lenses consisting of stepped
annular rings. Neither of these proposals, however, was intended to
apply to lighthouse purposes. In 1822 Augustin Fresnel constructed
a built-up annular lens in which the centres of curvature of the
different rings receded from the axis according to their distances
from the centre, so as practically to eliminate spherical aberration;
the only spherical surface being the small central part or &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s
eye&rdquo; (fig. 32). These lenses were intended for revolving lights only.
Fresnel next produced his cylindric refractor or lens belt, consisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id="page634"></a>634</span>
of a zone of glass generated by the revolution round a vertical axis
of a medial section of the annular lens (fig. 33). The lens belt condensed
and parallelized the light rays in the vertical plane only,
while the annular lens does so in every plane. The first revolving
light constructed from Fresnel&rsquo;s designs was erected at the Cordouan
lighthouse in 1823. It consisted of 8 panels of annular lenses placed
round the lamp at a focal distance of 920 mm. To utilize the light,
which would otherwise escape above the lenses, Fresnel introduced a
series of 8 plain silvered mirrors, on which the light was thrown by a
system of lenses. At a subsequent period mirrors were also placed
in the lower part of the optic. The apparatus was revolved by clockwork.
This optic embodied the first combination of dioptric and
catoptric elements in one design (fig. 34). In the following year
Fresnel designed a dioptric lens with catoptric mirrors for fixed light,
which was the first of its kind installed in a lighthouse. It was erected
at the Chassiron lighthouse in 1827 (fig. 35). This combination
is geometrically perfect, but not so practically on account of the great
loss of light entailed by metallic reflection which is at least 25%
greater than the system described under. Before his death in 1827
Fresnel devised his totally reflecting or catadioptric prisms to take
the place of the silvered reflectors previously used above and below the
lens elements (fig. 28). The ray Fi falling on the prismoidal ring ABC
is refracted in the direction <i>i r</i> and meeting the face AB at an angle
of incidence greater than the
critical, is totally reflected in
the direction <i>r e</i> emerging
after second refraction in a
horizontal direction. Fresnel
devised these prisms for use
in fixed light apparatus, but
the principle was, at a later
date, also applied to flashing lights, in the first instance by
T. Stevenson. Both the dioptric lens and catadioptric prism
invented by Fresnel are still in general use, the mathematical
calculations of the great French designer still forming the basis
upon which lighthouse opticians work.</p>

<p>Fresnel also designed a form of fixed and flashing light in which
the distinction of a fixed light, varied by flashes, was produced by
placing panels of straight refracting prisms in a vertical position on
a revolving carriage
outside the fixed light
apparatus. The revolution
of the upright
prisms periodically increased
the power of
the beam, by condensation
of the rays
emergent from the
fixed apparatus, in the
horizontal plane.</p>

<p>The lens segments in
Fresnel&rsquo;s early apparatus
were of polygonal form instead of cylindrical, but subsequently
manufacturers succeeded in grinding glass in cylindrical rings of
the form now used. The first apparatus of this description was
made by Messrs Cookson of Newcastle in 1836 at the suggestion
of Alan Stevenson and erected at Inchkeith.</p>

<p>In 1825 the French Commission des Phares decided upon the
exclusive use of lenticular
apparatus in its service.
The Scottish Lighthouse
Board followed with the
Inchkeith revolving apparatus
in 1835 and the
Isle of May fixed optic in
1836. In the latter instrument
Alan Stevenson introduced
helical frames for
holding the glass prisms in
place, thus avoiding complete
obstruction of the
light rays in any azimuth.
The first dioptric light
erected by the Trinity
House was that formerly
at Start Point in Devonshire,
constructed in 1836.
Catadioptric or reflecting
prisms for revolving lights
were not used until 1850,
when Alan Stevenson designed them for the North Ronaldshay
lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id="page635"></a>635</span></p>

<p><i>Dioptric Mirror.</i>&mdash;The next important improvement in lighthouse
optical work was the invention of the dioptric spherical mirror by
Mr (afterwards Sir) J. T. Chance in 1862. The zones or prisms are
generated round a vertical axis and divided into segments. This
form of mirror is still in general use (figs. 36 and 37).</p>

<p><i>Azimuthal Condensing Prisms.</i>&mdash;Previous to 1850 all apparatus
were designed to emit light of equal power in every azimuth either
constantly or periodically.
The only exception
was where a light
was situated on a
stretch of coast where
a mirror could be
placed behind the
flame to utilize the
rays, which would
otherwise pass landward,
and reflect them
back, passing through
the flame and lens
in a seaward direction. In order to increase the intensity of
lights in certain azimuths T. Stevenson devised his azimuthal
condensing prisms which, in various forms and methods of application,
have been largely used for the purpose of strengthening the
light rays in required directions as, for instance, where coloured
sectors are provided. Applications of this system will be referred
to subsequently.</p>

<p><i>Optical Glass for Lighthouses.</i>&mdash;In the early days of lens lights
the only glass used for the prisms was made in France at the St
Gobain and Premontré works, which have
long been celebrated for the high quality
of optical glass produced. The early dioptric
lights erected in the United Kingdom,
some 13 in all, were made by Messrs Cookson
of South Shields, who were instructed
by Léonor Fresnel, the brother of Augustin.
At first they tried to mould the lens and
then to grind it out of one thick sheet of
glass. The successors of the Cookson firm
abandoned the manufacture of lenses in
1845, and the firm of Letourneau &amp;
Lepaute of Paris again became the monopolists.
In 1850 Messrs Chance Bros. &amp; Co.
of Birmingham began the manufacture of
optical glass, assisted by M. Tabouret, a
French expert who had been a colleague
of Augustin Fresnel himself. The first light
made by the firm was shown at the Great
Exhibition of 1851, since when numerous
dioptric apparatus have been constructed
by Messrs Chance, who are, at this time,
the only manufacturers of lighthouse glass
in the United Kingdom. Most of the glass
used for apparatus constructed in France
is manufactured at St Gobain. Some of
the glass used by German constructors is
made at Rathenow in Prussia and Goslar
in the Harz.</p>

<p>The glass generally employed for lighthouse optics has for its
refractive index a mean value of µ = 1.51, the corresponding critical
angle being 41° 30&prime;. Messrs Chance have used dense flint glass for
the upper and lower refracting rings of high angle lenses and for
dioptric mirrors in certain cases. This glass has a value of µ = l.62
with critical angle 38° 5&prime;.</p>

<p><i>Occulting Lights.</i>&mdash;During the last 25 years of the 19th century
the disadvantages of fixed lights became more and more apparent.
At the present day the practice of installing such, except occasionally
in the case of the smaller and less important of harbour or river
lights, has practically ceased. The necessity for providing a distinctive
characteristic for every light when possible has led to the
conversion of many of the fixed-light apparatus of earlier years into
occulting lights, and often to their supersession by more modern
and powerful flashing apparatus. An occulting apparatus in
general use consists of a cylindrical screen, fitting over the burner,
rapidly lowered and raised by means of a cam-wheel at stated
intervals. The cam-wheel is actuated by means of a weight or
spring clock. Varying characteristics may be procured by means
of such a contrivance&mdash;single, double, triple or other systems of
occultation. The eclipses or
periods of darkness bear
much the same relation to
the times of illumination as
do the flashes to the eclipses
in a revolving or flashing
light. In the case of a first-order
fixed light the cost of
conversion to an occulting
characteristic does not exceed
£250 to £300. With apparatus
illuminated by gas
the occultations may be produced
by successively raising
and lowering the gas at stated
intervals. Another form of
occulting mechanism employed
consists of a series of
vertical screens mounted on
a carriage and revolving
round the burner. The carriage
is rotated on rollers or
ball bearings or carried upon
a small mercury float. The
usual driving mechanism
employed is a spring clock.
&ldquo;Otter&rdquo; screens are used in
cases when it is desired to
produce different periods of
occultations in two or more
positions in azimuth in order
to differentiate sectors marking
shoals, &amp;c. The screens
are of sheet metal blacked
and arranged vertically, some
what in the manner of the
laths of a venetian blind, and
operated by mechanical
means.</p>

<p><i>Leading Lights.</i>&mdash;In the
case of lights designed to act
as a lead through a narrow
channel or as direction lights,
it is undesirable to employ a
flashing apparatus. Fixed-light
optics are employed to
meet such cases, and are
generally fitted with occulting
mechanism. A typical apparatus
of this description
is that at Gage Roads,
Fremantle, West Australia
(fig. 38). The occulting
bright light covers the fairway,
and is flanked by sectors
of occulting red and green
light marking dangers and
intensified by vertical condensing
prisms. A good
example of a holophotal
direction light was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, and
afterwards erected at Suzac lighthouse (France). The light consists
of an annular lens 500 mm. focal distance, of 180° horizontal
angle and 157° vertical, with a mirror of 180° at the back. The
lens throws a red beam of about 4½° amplitude in azimuth, and
50,000 candle-power over a narrow channel. The illuminant is an
incandescent petroleum vapour burner. Holophotal direction lenses
of this type can only be applied where the
sector to be marked is of comparatively small
angle. Silvered metallic mirrors of parabolic
form are also used for the purpose. The use of
single direction lights frequently renders the
construction of separate towers for leading
lights unnecessary.</p>

<p>If two distinct lights are employed to indicate
the line of navigation through a channel
or between dangers they must be sufficiently
far apart to afford a good lead, the front or
seaward light being situated at a lower elevation
than the rear or landward one.</p>

<p><i>Coloured Lights.</i>&mdash;Colour is used as seldom
as possible as a distinction, entailing as it
does a considerable reduction in the power of the light. It is
necessary in some instances for differentiating sectors over
dangers and for harbour lighting purposes. The use of coloured
lights as alternating flashes for lighthouse lights is not to be commended,
on account of the unequal absorption of the coloured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id="page636"></a>636</span>
and bright rays by the atmosphere. When such distinction
has been employed, as in the Wolf Rock apparatus, the red and
white beams can be approximately equalized in initial intensity by
constructing the lens and prism panels for the red light of larger
angle than those for the white beams. Owing to the absorption by
the red colouring, the power of a red beam is only 40% of the
intensity of the corresponding white light. The corresponding
intensity of green light is 25%. When red or green sectors are
employed they should invariably be reinforced by mirrors, azimuthal
condensing prisms, or other means to raise the coloured beam to
approximately the same intensity as the white light. With the
introduction of group-flashing characteristics the necessity for using
colour as a means of distinction disappeared.</p>

<p><i>High-Angle Vertical Lenses.</i>&mdash;Messrs Chance of Birmingham have
manufactured lenses having 97° of vertical amplitude, but this
result was only
attained by using
dense flint glass of
high refractive
index for the
upper and lower
elements. It is
doubtful, however,
whether the
use of refracting
elements for a
greater angle than 80° vertically is attended by any material
corresponding advantage.</p>

<p><i>Group Flashing Lights.</i>&mdash;One of the most useful distinctions
consists in the grouping of two or more flashes separated by short
intervals of darkness, the group being succeeded by a longer eclipse.
Thus two, three or more flashes of, say, half second duration or less
follow each other at intervals of about 2 seconds and are succeeded
by an eclipse of, say, 10 seconds, the sequence being completed in a
period of, say, 15 seconds. In 1874 Dr John Hopkinson introduced
the very valuable improvement of dividing the lenses of a dioptric
revolving light with the panels of reflecting prisms above and below
them, setting them at an angle to produce the group-flashing
characteristic. The first apparatus of this type constructed were
those now in use at Tampico, Mexico and the Little Basses lighthouse,
Ceylon (double flashing). The Casquets apparatus (triple
flashing) was installed in 1877. A group-flashing catoptric light had,
however, been exhibited from the &ldquo;Royal Sovereign&rdquo; light-vessel in
1875. A sectional plan of the quadruple-flashing first order apparatus
at Pendeen in Cornwall is shown in fig. 39; and fig. 55 (Plate 1.)
illustrates a double flashing first order light at Pachena Point in
British Columbia. Hopkinson&rsquo;s system has been very extensively
used, most of the group-flashing lights shown in the accompanying
tables, being designed upon the general lines he introduced. A
modification of the system consists in grouping two or more lenses
together separated by equal angles, and filling the remaining angle
in azimuth by a reinforcing mirror or screen. A group-flashing
distinction was proposed for gas lights by J. R. Wigham of Dublin,
who obtained it in the case of a revolving apparatus by alternately
raising and lowering the flame. The first apparatus in which this
method was employed was erected at Galley Head, Co. Cork (1878).
At this lighthouse 4 of Wigham&rsquo;s large gas burners with four tiers
of first-order revolving lenses, eight in each tier, were adopted. By
successive lowering and raising of the gas flame at the focus of each
tier of lenses he produced the group-flashing distinction. The light
showed, instead of one prolonged flash at intervals of one minute,
as would be produced by the apparatus in the absence of a gas
occulter, a group of short flashes varying in number between six
and seven. The uncertainty, however, in the number of flashes
contained in each group is found to be an objection to the arrangement.
This device was adopted at other gas-illuminated stations in
Ireland at subsequent dates. The quadriform apparatus and gas
installation at Galley Head were superseded in 1907 by a first order
bi-form apparatus with incandescent oil vapour burner showing five
flashes every 20 seconds.</p>

<p><i>Flashing Lights indicating Numbers.</i>&mdash;Captain F. A. Mahan, late
engineer secretary to the United States Lighthouse Board, devised
for that service a
system of flashing
lights to indicate
certain numbers.
The apparatus installed
at Minot&rsquo;s
Ledge lighthouse
near Boston Harbour,
Massachusetts,
has a
flash indicating
the number 143,
thus: - ---- ---,
the dashes indicating
short
flashes. Each
group is separated
by a longer
period of darkness
than that
between successive
members of
a group. The
flashes in a group indicating a figure are about 1½ seconds apart,
the groups being 3 seconds apart, an interval of 16 seconds&rsquo; darkness
occurring between each repetition. Thus the number is
repeated every half minute. Two examples of this system were
exhibited by the United States Lighthouse Board at the Chicago
Exhibition in 1893, viz. the second-order apparatus just mentioned
and a similar light of the first order for Cape Charles
on the Virginian coast. The lenses are arranged in a somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id="page637"></a>637</span>
similar manner to an ordinary group-flashing light, the groups of
lenses being placed on one side of the optic, while the other is provided
with a catadioptric mirror. This system of numerical flashing
for lighthouses has been frequently proposed in various forms,
notably by Lord Kelvin. The installation of the lights described is,
however, the first practical application of the system to large and
important coast lights. The great cost involved in the alteration of
the lights of any country to comply with the requirements of a
numerical system is one of the objections to its general adoption.</p>

<p><i>Hyper-radial Apparatus.</i>&mdash;In 1885 Messrs Barbier of Paris constructed
the first hyper-radial apparatus (1330 mm. focal distance)
to the design of Messrs D. and C. Stevenson. This had a height of
1812 mm. It was tested during the South Foreland experiments in
comparison with other lenses, and found to give excellent results
with burners of large focal diameter. Apparatus of similar focal
distance (1330 mm.) were subsequently established at Round
Island, Bishop Rock, and Spurn Point in England, Fair Isle and
Sule Skerry (fig. 40) in Scotland, Bull Rock and Tory Island in
Ireland, Cape d&rsquo;Antifer
in France, Pei Yu-shan
in China and a lighthouse
in Brazil.</p>

<p>The light erected in
1907 at Cape Race,
Newfoundland, is a fine
example of a four-sided
hyper-radial apparatus
mounted on a mercury
float. The total weight
of the revolving part of
the light amounts to 7
tons, while the motive
clock weight required to
rotate this large mass at
a speed of two complete
revolutions a minute is
only 8 cwt. and the
weight of mercury required
for flotation
950 &#8468;. A similar apparatus
was placed at
Manora Point, Karachi,
India, in 1908 (fig. 41).</p>

<p>The introduction of
incandescent and other
burners of focal compactness
and high intensity
has rendered the use of
optics of such large dimensions
as the above,
intended for burners of
great focal diameter, unnecessary. It is now possible to obtain with a
second-order optic (or one of 700 mm. focal distance), having a
powerful incandescent petroleum burner in focus, a beam of equal
intensity to that which would be obtained from the apparatus
having a 10-wick oil burner or 108-jet gas burner at its focus.</p>

<p><i>Stephenson&rsquo;s Spherical Lenses and Equiangular Prisms.</i>&mdash;Mr C. A.
Stephenson in 1888 designed a form of lens spherical in the horizontal
and vertical sections. This admitted of the construction of lenses
of long focal distance without the otherwise corresponding necessity
of increased diameter of lantern. A lens of this type and of 1330 mm.
focal distance was constructed in 1890 for Fair Isle lighthouse.
The spherical form loses in efficiency if carried beyond an angle
subtending 20° at the focus, and to obviate this loss Mr Stephenson
designed his equiangular prisms, which have an inclination outwards.
It is claimed by the designer that the use of equiangular
prisms results in less loss of light and less divergence than is the
case when either the spherical or Fresnel form is adopted. An
example of this design is seen (fig. 40) in the Sule Skerry apparatus
(1895).</p>

<p><i>Fixed and Flashing Lights.</i>&mdash;The use of these lights, which show
a fixed beam varied at intervals by more powerful flashes, is not to
be recommended, though a large number were constructed in the
earlier years of dioptric illumination and many are still in existence.
The distinction can be produced in one or other of three ways:
(<i>a</i>) by the revolution of detached panels of straight condensing lens
prisms placed vertically around a fixed light optic, (<i>b</i>) by utilizing
revolving lens panels in the middle portion of the optic to produce
the flashing light, the upper and lower sections of the apparatus
being fixed zones of catadioptric or reflecting elements emitting a
fixed belt of light, and (<i>c</i>) by interposing panels of fixed light section
between the flashing light panels of a revolving apparatus. In
certain conditions of the atmosphere it is possible for the fixed light
of low power to be entirely obscured while the flashes are visible,
thus vitiating the true characteristic of the light. Cases have
frequently occurred of such lights being mistaken for, and even
described in lists of light as, revolving or flashing lights.</p>

<p><i>&rdquo;Cute&rdquo; and Screens.</i>&mdash;Screens of coloured glass, intended to distinguish
the light in particular azimuths, and of sheet iron, when it
is desired to &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; the light sharply on any angle, should be
fixed as far from the centre of the light as possible in order to reduce
the escape of light rays due to divergence. These screens are
usually attached to the lantern framing.</p>

<p><i>Divergence.</i>&mdash;A dioptric apparatus designed to bend all incident
rays of light from the light source in a horizontal direction would,
if the flame could be a point, have the effect of projecting a horizontal
band or zone of light, in the case of a fixed apparatus, and a cylinder
of light rays, in the case of a flashing light, towards the horizon.
Thus the mariner in the near distance would receive no light, the
rays, visible only at or near the horizon, passing above the level of
his eye. In practice this does not occur, sufficient natural divergence
being produced ordinarily owing to the magnitude of the flame.
Where the electric arc is employed it is often necessary to design
the prisms so as to produce artificial divergence. The measure of
the natural divergence for any point of the lens is the angle whose
sine is the ratio of the diameter of the flame to the distance of the
point from centre of flame.</p>

<p>In the case of vertical divergence the mean height of the flame
must be substituted for the diameter. The angle thus obtained is
the total divergence, that is, the sum of the angles above and below
the horizontal plane or to right and left of the medial section. In
fixed dioptric lights there is, of course, no divergence in the horizontal
plane. In flashing lights the horizontal divergence is a matter of
considerable importance, determining as it does the duration or
length of time the flash is visible to the mariner.</p>

<p><i>Feux-Éclairs or Quick Flashing Lights.</i>&mdash;One of the most important
developments in the character of lighthouse illuminating
apparatus that has occurred in recent years has been in the direction
of reducing the length of flash. The initiative in this matter was
taken by the French lighthouse authorities, and in France alone
forty lights of this type were established between 1892 and 1901.
The use of short flash lights rapidly spread to other parts of the world.
In England the lighthouse at Pendeen (1900) exhibits a quadruple
flash every 15 seconds, the flashes being about ¼ second duration
(fig. 39), while the bivalve apparatus erected on Lundy Island
(1897) shows 2 flashes of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> second duration in quick succession every
20 seconds. Since 1900 many quick flashing lights have been
erected on the coasts of the United Kingdom and in other countries.
The early <i>feux-éclairs</i>, designed by the French engineers and others,
had usually a flash of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>th to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>rd of a second duration. As a result of
experiments carried out in France in 1903-1904, <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> second has been
adopted by the French authorities as the minimum duration for
white flashing lights. If shorter flashes are used it is found that the
reduction in duration is attended by a corresponding, but not proportionate,
diminution in effective intensity. In the case of many
electric flashing lights the duration is of necessity reduced, but
the greater initial intensity of the flash permits this loss without
serious detriment to efficiency. Red or green requires a considerably
greater duration than do white flashes. The intervals between the
flashes in lights of this character are also small, 2½ seconds to 7
seconds. In group-flashing lights the intervals between the flashes
are about 2 seconds or even less, with periods of 7 to 10 or 15 seconds
between the groups. The flashes are arranged in single, double,
triple or even quadruple groups, as in the older forms of apparatus.
The <i>feu-éclair</i> type of apparatus enables a far higher intensity
of flash to be obtained than was previously possible without any
corresponding increase in the luminous power of the burner or
other source of light. This result depends entirely upon the greater
ratio of condensation of light employed, panels of greater angular
breadth than was customary in the older forms of apparatus being
used with a higher rotatory velocity. It has been urged that short
flashes are insufficient for taking bearings, but the utility of a light
in this respect does not seem to depend so much upon the actual
length of the flash as upon its frequent recurrence at short intervals.
At the Paris Exhibition of 1900 was exhibited a fifth-order flashing
light giving short flashes at 1 second intervals; this represents the
extreme to which the movement towards the reduction of the
period of flashing lights has yet been carried.</p>

<p><i>Mercury Floats.</i>&mdash;It has naturally been found impracticable to
revolve the optical apparatus of a light with its mountings, sometimes
weighing over 7 tons, at the high rate of speed required for
<i>feux-éclairs</i> by means of the old system of roller carriages, though
for some small quick-revolving lights ball bearings have been
successfully adopted. It has therefore become almost the universal
practice to carry the rotating portions of the apparatus upon a
mercury float. This beautiful application of mercury rotation was
the invention of Bourdelles, and is now utilized not only for the
high-speed apparatus, but also generally for the few examples of
the older type still being constructed. The arrangement consists
of an annular cast iron bath or trough of such dimensions that a
similar but slightly smaller annular float immersed in the bath and
surrounded by mercury displaces a volume of the liquid metal
whose weight is equal to that of the apparatus supported. Thus a
comparatively insignificant quantity of mercury, say 2 cwt., serves
to ensure the flotation of a mass of over 3 tons. Certain differences
exist between the type of float usually constructed in France and
those generally designed by English engineers. In all cases provision
is made for lowering the mercury bath or raising the float
and apparatus for examination. Examples of mercury floats are
shown in figs. 41, 42, 43 and Plate I., figs. 54 <span class="correction" title="amended from an">and</span> 55.</p>

<p><i>Multiform Apparatus.</i>&mdash;In
order to double the
power to be obtained from
a single apparatus at
stations where lights of
exceptionally high intensity
are desired, the expedient
of placing one
complete lens apparatus
above another has sometimes
been adopted, as at
the Bishop Rock (fig. 13),
and at the Fastnet lighthouse
in Ireland (Plate I.,
fig. 54). Triform and quadriform
apparatus have also
been erected in Ireland;
particulars of the Tory
Island triform apparatus
will be found in table VII.
The adoption of the multiform
system involves the
use of lanterns of increased
height.</p>

<p><i>Twin Apparatus.</i>&mdash;Another
method of doubling
the power of a light is
by mounting two complete
and distinct optics side by
side on the same revolving
table, as I shown in fig. 43
of the Île Vierge apparatus.
Several such lights
have been installed by
the French Lighthouse
Service.</p>

<p><i>Port Lights.</i>&mdash;Small self-contained
lanterns and
lights are in common use
for marking the entrances
to harbours and in other
similar positions where
neither high power nor
long range is requisite.
Many such lights are unattended
in the sense that
they do not require the
attention of a keeper for
days and even weeks
together. These are described
in more detail in
section 6 of this article.
A typical port light consists
of a copper or brass
lantern containing a lens
of the fourth order (250
mm. focal distance) or
smaller, and a single wick
or 2-wick Argand capillary
burner. Duplex burners
are also used. The apparatus
may exhibit a fixed
light or, more usually, an
occulting characteristic is
produced by the revolution
of screens actuated by
spring clockwork around
the burner. The lantern
may be placed at the top
of a column, or suspended
from the head of a mast.
Coal gas and electricity are
also used as illuminants
for port lights when local
supplies are available. The
optical apparatus used in
connexion with electric
light is described below.</p>

<p><i>&rdquo;Orders&rdquo; of Apparatus.</i>&mdash;Augustin
Fresnel divided
the dioptric lenses, designed
by him, into &ldquo;orders&rdquo;
or sizes depending on their
local distance. This division
is still used, although
two additional &ldquo;orders,&rdquo;
known as &ldquo;small third
order&rdquo; and &ldquo;hyper-radial&rdquo;
respectively are in ordinary
use. The following

<p><i>Light Intensities.</i>&mdash;The powers of lighthouse lights in the British
Empire are expressed in terms of standard candles or in &ldquo;lighthouse
units&rdquo; (one lighthouse unit = 1000 standard candles). In
France the unit is the &ldquo;Carcel&rdquo; = .952 standard candle. The
powers of burners and optical apparatus, then in use in the United
Kingdom, were carefully determined by actual photometric measurement
in 1892 by a committee consisting of the engineers of the three
general lighthouse boards, and the values so obtained are used as
the basis for calculating the intensities of all British lights. It was
found that the intensities determined by photometric measurement
were considerably less than the values given by the theoretical
calculations formerly employed. A deduction of 20% was made
from the mean experimental results obtained to compensate for
loss by absorption in the lantern glass, variations in effects obtained
by different men in working the burners and in the illuminating
quality of oils, &amp;c. The resulting reduced values are termed &ldquo;service&rdquo;
intensities.</p>

<p>As has been explained above, the effect of a dioptric apparatus
is to condense the light rays, and the measure of this condensation
is the ratio between the vertical divergence and the vertical angle
of the optic in the case of fixed lights. In flashing lights the ratio
of vertical condensation must be multiplied by the ratio between
the horizontal divergence and the horizontal angle of the panel.
The loss of light by absorption in passing through the glass and by
refraction varies from 10% to 15%. For apparatus containing
catadioptric elements a larger deduction must be made.</p>

<p>The intensity of the flash emitted from a dioptric apparatus,
showing a white light, may be found approximately by the empirical
formula I = PCVH/<i>vh</i>, where I = intensity of resultant beam, P = service
intensity of flame, V = vertical angle of optic, <i>v</i> = angle of
mean vertical divergence, H = horizontal angle of panel, <i>h</i> = angle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page640" id="page640"></a>640</span>
of mean horizontal divergence, and C = constant varying between
.9 and .75 according to the description of apparatus. The factor
H/<i>h</i> must be eliminated in the case of fixed lights. Deduction must
also be made in the case of coloured lights. It should, however,
be pointed out that photometric measurements alone can be relied
upon to give accurate values for lighthouse intensities. The values
obtained by the use of Allard&rsquo;s formulae, which were largely used
before the necessity for actual photometric measurements came to
be appreciated, are considerably in excess of the true intensities.</p>

<p><i>Optical Calculations.</i>&mdash;The mathematical theory of optical apparatus
for lighthouses and formulae for the calculations of profiles will
be found in the works of the Stevensons, Chance, Allard, Reynaud,
Ribière and others. Particulars of typical lighthouse apparatus
will be found in tables VI. and VII.</p>
</div>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Illuminants.</span>&mdash;The earliest form of illuminant used for
lighthouses was a fire of coal or wood set in a brazier or grate
erected on top of the lighthouse tower. Until the end of the 18th
and even into the 19th century this primitive illuminant continued
to be almost the only one in use. The coal fire at the Isle of
May light continued until 1810 and that at St Bees lighthouse
in Cumberland till 1823. Fires are stated to have been used
on the two towers of Nidingen, in the Kattegat, until 1846.
Smeaton was the first to use any form of illuminant other than
coal fires; he placed within the lantern of his Eddystone lighthouse
a chandelier holding 24 tallow candles each of which
weighed <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> of a &#8468; and emitted a light of 2.8 candle power.
The aggregate illuminating power was 67.2 candles and the
consumption at the rate of 3.4 &#8468; per hour.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Oil.</i>&mdash;Oil lamps with flat wicks were used in the Liverpool lighthouses
as early as 1763. Argand, between 1780 and 1783, perfected
his cylindrical wick lamp which provides a central current of air
through the burner, thus allowing the more perfect combustion of
the gas issuing from the wick. The contraction in the diameter of
the glass chimney used with wick lamps is due to Lange, and the
principle of the multiple wick burner was devised by Count Rumford.
Fresnel produced burners having two, three and four concentric
wicks. Sperm oil, costing 5s. to 8s. per gallon, was used in English
lighthouses until 1846, but about that year colza oil was employed
generally at a cost of 2s. 9d. per gallon. Olive oil, lard oil and
coconut oil have also been used for lighthouse purposes in various
parts of the world.</p>

<p><i>Mineral Oil Burners.</i>&mdash;The introduction of mineral oil, costing a
mere fraction of the expensive animal and vegetable oils, revolutionized
the illumination of lighthouses. It was not until 1868 that
a burner was devised which successfully consumed hydrocarbon
oils. This was a multiple wick burner invented by Captain Doty.
The invention was quickly taken advantage of by lighthouse
authorities, and the &ldquo;Doty&rdquo; burner, and other patterns involving
the same principle, remained practically the only oil burners in
lighthouse use until the last few years of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The lamps used for supplying oil to the burner are of two general
types, viz. those in which the oil is maintained under pressure by
mechanical action and constant level lamps. In the case of single
wick, and some 2-wick burners, oil is supplied to the burner by the
capillary action of the wick alone.</p>

<p>The mineral oils ordinarily in use are petroleum, which for
lighthouse purposes should have a specific gravity of from .820 to
.830 at 60° F. and flashing point of not less than 230° F. (Abel close
test), and Scottish shale oil or paraffin with a specific gravity of
about .810 at 60° F. and flash point of 140° to 165° F. Both these
varieties may be obtained in England at a cost of about 6½d. per
gallon in bulk.</p>

<p><i>Coal Gas</i> had been introduced in 1837 at the inner pier light of
Troon (Ayrshire) and in 1847 it was in use at the Heugh lighthouse
(West Hartlepool). In 1878 cannel coal gas was adopted for the
Galley Head lighthouse, with 108-jet Wigham burners. Sir James
Douglass introduced gas burners consisting of concentric rings,
two to ten in number, perforated on the upper edges. These give
excellent results and high intensity, 2600 candles in the case of the
10-ring burner with a flame diameter at the focal plane of 5<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.
They are still in use at certain stations. The use of multiple ring
and jet gas burners is not being further extended. Gas for lighthouse
purposes generally requires to be specially made; the erection
of gas works at the station is thus necessitated and a considerable
outlay entailed which is avoided by the use of oil as an illuminant.</p>

Oil Burner, with 85 mm. diameter
mantle.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Incandescent Coal Gas Burners.</i>&mdash;The invention of the Welsbach
mantle placed at the disposal of the lighthouse authorities the
means of producing a light of high intensity combined with great
focal compactness. For lighthouse purposes other gaseous illuminants
than coal gas are as a rule more convenient and economical,
and give better results with incandescent mantles. Mantles have,
however, been used with ordinary coal gas in many instances where
a local supply is available.</p>

<p><i>Incandescent Mineral Oil Burners.</i>&mdash;Incandescent lighting with
high-flash mineral oil was first introduced by the French Lighthouse
Service in 1898 at L&rsquo;Île Penfret lighthouse. The burners employed
are all made on the same principle, but differ slightly in details
according to the type of lighting apparatus for which they are
intended. The principle consists in injecting the liquid petroleum
in the form of spray mixed with air into a vaporizer heated by the
mantle flame or by a subsidiary heating burner. A small reservoir
of compressed air is used&mdash;charged
by means of a hand
pump&mdash;for providing the
necessary pressure for injection.
On first ignition the
vaporizer is heated by a spirit
flame to the required temperature.
A reservoir air pressure
of 125 &#8468; per sq. in. is employed,
a reducing valve supplying air
to the oil at from 60 to 65 &#8468;
per sq. in. Small reservoirs
containing liquefied carbon
dioxide have also been employed
for supplying the requisite
pressure to the oil vessel.</p>

<p>The candle-power of apparatus
in which ordinary multiple
wick burners were formerly
employed is increased by over
300% by the substitution of
suitable incandescent oil
burners. In 1902 incandescent
oil burners were adopted by the
general lighthouse authorities
in the United Kingdom. The
burners used in the Trinity
House Service and some of
those made in France have
the vaporizers placed over the
flame. In other forms, of
which the &ldquo;Chance&rdquo; burner (fig. 44) is a type, the vaporization
is effected by means of a subsidiary burner placed under the main
flame.</p>

<p>The intrinsic brightness of incandescent burners generally may be
taken as being equivalent to from 30 candles to 40 candles per sq.
cm. of the vertical section of the incandescent mantle.</p>

<p>In the case of wick burners, the intrinsic brightness varies, according
to the number of wicks and the type of burner from about
3.5 candles to about 12 candles per sq. cm., the value being at its
maximum with the larger type of burner. The luminous intensity
of a beam from a dioptric apparatus is, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, proportional
to the intrinsic brightness of the luminous source of flame, and not
of the total luminous intensity. The intrinsic brightness of the
flame of oil burners increases only slightly with their focal diameter,
consequently while the consumption of oil increases the efficiency
of the burner for a given apparatus decreases. The illuminating
power of the condensed beam can only be improved to a slight
extent, and, in fact, is occasionally decreased, by increasing the
number of wicks in the burner. The same argument applies to the
case of multiple ring and multiple jet gas burners which, notwithstanding
their large total intensity, have comparatively small
intrinsic brightness. The economy of the new system is instanced
by the case of the Eddystone bi-form apparatus, which with the
concentric 6-wick burner consuming 2500 gals. of oil per annum,
gave a total intensity of 79,250 candles. Under the new régime the
intensity is 292,000 candles, the oil consumption being practically
halved.</p>

<p><i>Incandescent Oil Gas Burners.</i>&mdash;It has been mentioned that
incandescence with low-pressure coal gas produces flames of comparatively
small intrinsic brightness. Coal gas cannot be compressed
beyond a small extent without considerable injurious condensation
and other accompanying evils. Recourse has therefore
been had to compressed oil gas, which is capable of undergoing
compression to 10 or 12 atmospheres with little detriment, and
can conveniently be stored in portable reservoirs. The burner
employed resembles the ordinary Bunsen burner with incandescent
mantle, and the rate of consumption of gas is 27.5 cub. in. per hour
per candle. A reducing valve is used for supplying the gas to the
burner at constant pressure. The burners can be left unattended
for considerable periods. The system was first adopted in France,
where it is installed at eight lighthouses, among others the Ar&rsquo;men
Rock light, and has been extended to other parts of the world
including several stations in Scotland and England. The mantles
used in France are of 35 mm. diameter. The 35 mm. mantle gives a
candle-power of 400, with an intrinsic brightness of 20 candles
per sq. cm.</p>

<p>The use of oil gas necessitates the erection of gas works at the
lighthouse or its periodical supply in portable reservoirs from a
neighbouring station. A complete gas works plant costs about £800.
The annual expenditure for gas lighting in France does not exceed
£72 per light where works are installed, or £32 where gas is supplied
from elsewhere. In the case of petroleum vapour lighting the annual
cost of oil amounts to about £26 per station.</p>

<p><i>Acetylene.</i>&mdash;The high illuminating power and intrinsic brightness
of the flame of acetylene makes it a very suitable illuminant for
lighthouses and beacons, providing certain difficulties attending
its use can be overcome. At Grangemouth an unattended 21-day
beacon has been illuminated by an acetylene flame for some years
with considerable success, and a beacon light designed to run unattended
for six months was established on Bedout Island in Western
Australia in 1910. Acetylene has also been used in the United
States, Germany, the Argentine, China, Canada, &amp;c., for lighthouse
and beacon illumination. Many buoys and beacons on the German
and Dutch coasts have been supplied with oil gas mixed with 20%
of acetylene, thereby obtaining an increase of over 100% in
illuminating intensity. In France an incandescent burner consuming
acetylene gas mixed with air has been installed at the Chassiron
lighthouse (1902). The French Lighthouse Service has perfected
an incandescent acetylene burner with a 55 mm. mantle having an
intensity of over 2000 candle-power, with intrinsic brightness of
60 candles per sq. cm.</p>

<p><i>Electricity.</i>&mdash;The first installation of electric light for lighthouse
purposes in England took place in 1858 at the South Foreland,
where the Trinity House established a temporary plant for experimental
purposes. This installation was followed in 1862 by the
adoption of the illuminant at the Dungeness lighthouse, where it
remained in service until the year 1874 when oil was substituted for
electricity. The earliest of the permanent installations now existing
in England is that at Souter Point which was illuminated in 1871.
There are in England four important coast lights illuminated by
electricity, and one, viz. Isle of May, in Scotland. Of the former
St Catherine&rsquo;s, in the Isle of Wight, and the Lizard are the most
powerful. <span class="correction" title="amended from Elctricity">Electricity</span> was substituted as an illuminant for the then
existing oil light at St Catherine&rsquo;s in 1888. The optical apparatus
consisted of a second-order 16-sided revolving lens, which was
transferred to the South Foreland station in 1904, and a new second
order (700 mm.) four-sided optic with a vertical angle of 139°,
exhibiting a flash of .21 second duration every 5 seconds substituted
for it. A fixed holophote is placed inside the optic in the dark or
landward arc, and at the focal plane of the lamp. This holophote
condenses the rays from the arc falling upon it into a pencil of
small angle, which is directed horizontally upon a series of reflecting
prisms which again bend the light and throw it downwards through
an aperture in the lantern floor on to another series of prisms, which
latter direct the rays seaward in the form of a sector of fixed red
light at a lower level in the tower. A somewhat similar arrangement
exists at Souter Point lighthouse.</p>

<p>The apparatus installed at the Lizard in 1903 is similar to that
at St Catherine&rsquo;s, but has no arrangement for producing a subsidiary
sector light. The flash is of .13 seconds duration every 3 seconds.
The apparatus replaced the two fixed electric lights erected in 1878.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span>&mdash;Isle of May Apparatus.</td></tr></table>

<p>The Isle of May lighthouse, at the mouth of the Firth of Forth,
was first illuminated by electricity in 1886. The optical apparatus
consists of a second-order fixed-light lens with reflecting prisms, and
is surrounded by a revolving system of vertical condensing prisms
which split up the vertically condensed beam of light into 8 separate
beams of 3° in azimuth. The prisms are so arranged that the
apparatus, making one complete revolution in the minute, produces
a group characteristic of 4 flashes in quick succession every 30
seconds (fig. 45). The fixed light is not of the ordinary Fresnel
section, the refracting portion being confined to an angle of 10°,
and the remainder of the vertical section consisting of reflecting
prisms.</p>

<p>In France the old south lighthouse at La Hève was lit by electricity
in 1863. This installation was followed in 1865 by a similar one at
the north lighthouse. In 1910 there were thirteen important coast
lights in France illuminated by electricity. In other parts of the
world, Macquarie lighthouse, Sydney, was lit by electricity in 1883;
Tino, in the gulf of Spezia, in 1885; and Navesink lighthouse, near
the entrance to New York Bay, in 1898. Electric apparatus were
also installed at the lighthouse at Port Said in 1869, on the opening
of the canal; Odessa in 1871; and at the Rothersand, North Sea,
in 1885. There are several other lights in various parts of the world
illuminated by this agency.</p>

<p>Incandescent electric lighting has been adopted for the illumination
of certain light-vessels in the United States, and a few small
harbour and port lights, beacons and buoys.</p>

<p>Table VI. gives particulars of some of the more important electric
lighthouses of the world.</p>

<p><i>Electric Lighthouse Installations in France.</i>&mdash;A list of the thirteen
lighthouses on the French coast equipped with electric light installations
will be found in table VI. It has been already mentioned that
the two lighthouses at La Hève were lit by electric light in 1863 and
1865. These installations were followed within a few years by the
establishment of electricity as illuminant at Gris-Nez. In 1882
M. Allard, the then director-general of the French Lighthouse
Service, prepared a scheme for the electric lighting of the French
littoral by means of 46 lights distributed more or less uniformly
along the coast-line. All the apparatus were to be of the same
general type, the optics consisting of a fixed belt of 300 mm. focal
distance, around the outside of which revolved a system of 24 faces
of vertical lenses. These vertical panels condensed the belt of fixed
light into beams of 3° amplitude in azimuth, producing flashes of
about ¾ sec. duration. To illuminate the near sea the vertical
divergence of the lower prisms of the fixed belt was artificially
increased. These optics are very similar to that in use at the Souter
Point lighthouse, Sunderland. The intensities obtained were 120,000
candles in the case of fixed lights and 900,000 candles with flashing
lights. As a result of a nautical inquiry held in 1886, at which date
the lights of Dunkerque, Calais, Gris-Nez, La Canche, Baleines and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page642" id="page642"></a>642</span>
Planier had been lighted, in addition to the old apparatus at La Hève,
it was decided to limit the installation of electrical apparatus to
important landfall lights&mdash;a decision which the Trinity House had
already arrived at in the case of the English coast&mdash;and to establish
new apparatus at six stations only. These were Créac&rsquo;h d&rsquo;Ouessant
(Ushant), Belle-Île, La Coubre at the mouth of the river Gironde,
Barfleur, Île d&rsquo;Yeu and Penmarc&rsquo;h. At the same time it was determined
to increase the powers of the existing electric lights. The
scheme as amended in 1886 was completed in 1902.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>All the electrically lit apparatus, in common with other optics
established in France since 1893, have been provided with mercury
rotation. The most recent electric lights have been constructed in
the form of twin apparatus, two complete and distinct optics being
mounted side by side upon the same revolving table and with
corresponding faces parallel. It is found that a far larger aggregate
candle-power is obtained from two lamps with 16 mm. to 23 mm.
diameter carbons and currents of 60 to 120 amperes than with carbons
and currents of larger dimensions in conjunction with single optics
of greater focal distance. A somewhat similar circumstance led to
the choice of the twin form for the two very powerful non-electric
apparatus at Île Vierge (figs. 43 and 43A) and Ailly, particulars of
which will be seen in table VII.</p>

<p>Several of the de Meritens magneto-electric machines of 5.5 K.W.,
laid down many years ago at French electric lighthouse stations, are
still in use. All these machines have five induction coils, which,
upon the installation of the twin optics, were separated into two
distinct circuits, each consisting of 2½ coils. This modification has
enabled the old plants to be used with success under the altered
conditions of lighting entailed by the use of two lamps. The generators
adopted in the French service for use at the later stations differ
materially from the old type of de Meritens machine. The Phare
d&rsquo;Eckmühl (Penmarc&rsquo;h) installation serves as a type of the more
modern machinery. The dynamos are alternating current two-phase
machines, and are installed in duplicate. The two lamps
are supplied with current from the same machine, the second
dynamo being held in reserve. The speed is 810 to 820 revolutions
per minute.</p>

<p>The lamp generally adopted is a combination of the Serrin and
Berjot principles, with certain modifications. Clockwork mechanism
with a regulating electromagnet moves the rods simultaneously
and controls the movements of the carbons so that they are displaced
at the same rate as they are consumed. It is usual to
employ currents of varying power with carbons of corresponding
dimensions according to the atmospheric conditions. In the French
service two variations are used in the case of twin apparatus
produced by currents of 60 and 120 amperes at 45 volts with carbons
14 mm. and 18 mm. diameter, while in single optic apparatus
currents of 25, 50 and 100 amperes are utilized with carbon of
11 mm., 16 mm. and 23 mm. diameter. In England fluted carbons
of larger diameter are employed with correspondingly increased
current. Alternating currents have given the most successful results
in all respects. Attempts to utilize continuous current for lighthouse
arc lights have, up to the present, met with little success.</p>

<p>The cost of a first-class electric lighthouse installation of the most
recent type in France, including optical apparatus, lantern, dynamos,
engines, air compressor, siren, &amp;c., but not buildings, amounts
approximately to £5900.</p>

<p><i>Efficiency of the Electric Light.</i>&mdash;In 1883 the lighthouse authorities
of Great Britain determined that an exhaustive series of experiments
should be carried out at the South Foreland with a view to ascertaining
the relative suitability of electricity, gas and oil as lighthouse
illuminants. The experiments extended over a period of more than
twelve months, and were attended by representatives of the chief
lighthouse authorities of the world. The results of the trials tended
to show that the rays of oil and gas lights suffered to about equal
extent by atmospheric absorption, but that oil had the advantage
over gas by reason of its greater economy in cost of maintenance
and in initial outlay on installation. The electric light was found to
suffer to a much larger extent than either oil or gas light per unit of
power by atmospheric absorption, but the infinitely greater total
intensity of the beam obtainable by its use, both by reason of the
high luminous intensity of the electric arc and its focal compactness,
more than outweighed the higher percentage of loss in fog. The
final conclusion of the committee on the relative merits of electricity,
gas or oil as lighthouse illuminants is given in the following words:
&ldquo;That for ordinary necessities of lighthouse illumination, mineral
oil is the most suitable and economical illuminant, and that for salient
headlands, important landfalls, and places where a very powerful
light is required electricity offers the greater advantages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5. <span class="sc">Miscellaneous Lighthouse Equipment.</span> <i>Lanterns.</i>&mdash;Modern
lighthouse lanterns usually consist of a cast iron or steel pedestal,
cylindrical in plan, on which is erected the lantern glazing, surmounted
by a domed roof and ventilator (fig. 41). Adequate
ventilation is of great importance, and is provided by means of
ventilators in the pedestal and a large ventilating dome or cowl in
the roof. The astragals carrying the glazing are of wrought steel
or gun-metal. The astragals are frequently arranged helically or
diagonally, thus causing a minimum of obstruction to the light rays
in any vertical section and affording greater rigidity to the structure.
The glazing is usually ¼-in. thick plate-glass curved to the radius
of the lantern. In situations of great exposure the thickness is
increased. Lantern roofs are of sheet steel or copper secured to steel
or cast-iron rafter frames. In certain instances it is found necessary
to erect a grille or network outside the lantern to prevent the numerous
sea birds, attracted by the light, from breaking the glazing by
impact. Lanterns vary in diameter from 5 ft. to 16 ft. or more,
according to the size of the optical apparatus. For first order
apparatus a diameter of 12 ft. or 14 ft. is usual.</p>

<p><i>Lightning Conductors.</i>&mdash;The lantern and principal metallic
structures in a lighthouse are usually connected to a lightning conductor
carried either to a point below low water or terminating in an
earth plate embedded in wet ground. Conductors may be of copper
tape or copper-wire rope.</p>

<p><i>Rotating Machinery.</i>&mdash;Flashing-light apparatus are rotated by
clockwork mechanism actuated by weights. The clocks are fitted
with speed governors and electric warning apparatus to indicate
variation in speed and when rewinding is required. For occulting
apparatus either weight clocks or spring clocks are employed.</p>

<p><i>Accommodation for Keepers, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;At rock and other isolated
stations, accommodation for the keepers is usually provided in the
towers. In the case of land lighthouses, dwellings are provided in
close proximity to the tower. The service or watch room should be
situated immediately under the lantern floor. Oil is usually stored
in galvanized steel tanks. A force pump is sometimes used for
pumping oil from the storage tanks to a service tank in the watch-room
or lantern.</p>

<p>6. <span class="sc">Unattended Lights and Beacons.</span>&mdash;Until recent years no
unattended lights were in existence. The introduction of Pintsch&rsquo;s
gas system in the early &rsquo;seventies provided a means of illumination
for beacons and buoys of which large use has been made. Other
illuminants are also in use to a considerable extent.</p>

<p><i>Unattended Electric Lights.</i>&mdash;In 1884 an iron beacon lighted by an
incandescent lamp supplied with current from a secondary battery
was erected on a tidal rock near Cadiz. A 28-day clock was arranged
for eclipsing the light between sunrise and sunset and automatically
cutting off the current at intervals to produce an occulting characteristic.
Several small dioptric apparatus illuminated with incandescent
electric lamps have been made by the firm of Barbier Bénard et
Turenne of Paris, and supplied with current from batteries of
Daniell cells, with electric clockwork mechanism for occulting the
light. These apparatus have been fitted to beacons and buoys, and
are generally arranged to automatically switch off the current
during the day-time. They run unattended for periods up to two
months. Two separate lenses and lamps are usually provided, with
lamp changer, only one lamp being in circuit at a time. In the event
of failure in the upper lamp of the two the current automatically
passes to the lower lamp.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 240px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:190px; height:453px" src="images/img642.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 46.</span>&mdash;Garvel Beacon.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Oil-gas Beacons.</i>&mdash;In 1881 a beacon automatically lighted by
Pintsch&rsquo;s compressed oil gas was erected on the river Clyde, and
large numbers of these structures have
since been installed in all parts of the
world. The gas is contained in an iron
or steel reservoir placed within the beacon
structure, refilled by means of a flexible
hose on the occasions of the periodical
visits of the tender. The beacons,
which remain illuminated for periods up
to three months are charged to 7 atmospheres.
Many lights are provided with
occulting apparatus actuated by the gas
passing from the reservoir to the burner
automatically cutting off and turning on
the supply. The Garvel beacon (1899)
on the Clyde is shown in fig. 46. The
burner has 7 jets, and the light is
occulting. Since 1907 incandescent
mantle burners for oil gas have been
largely used for beacon illumination, both
for fixed and occulting lights.</p>

<p>Acetylene has also been used for the
illumination of beacons and other unattended
lights.</p>

<p><i>Lindberg Lights.</i>&mdash;In 1881-1882 several
beacons lighted automatically by volatile
petroleum spirit on the Lindberg-Lyth
and Lindberg-Trotter systems were established
in Sweden. Many lights of this
type have subsequently been placed in
different parts of the world. The volatile
spirit lamp burns day and night. Occultations
are produced by a screen or series of screens rotated round the
light by the ascending current of heated air and gases from the lamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page643" id="page643"></a>643</span>
acting upon a horizontal fan. The speed of rotation of the fan
cannot be accurately adjusted, and the times of occultation therefore
are liable to slight variation. The lights run unattended for periods
up to twenty-one days.</p>

<p><i>Benson-Lee Lamps.</i>&mdash;An improvement upon the foregoing is the
Benson-Lee lamp, in which a similar occulting arrangement is often
used, but the illuminant is paraffin consumed in a special burner
having carbon-tipped wicks which require no trimming. The flame
intensity of the light is greater than that of the burner consuming
light spirit. The introduction of paraffin also avoids the danger
attending the use of the more volatile spirit. Many of these lights
are in use on the Scottish coast. They are also used in other parts of
the United Kingdom, and in the United States, Canada and other
countries.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Wick Lights.</i>&mdash;About 1891 the French Lighthouse
Service introduced petroleum lamps consuming ordinary high-flash
lighthouse oil, and burning without attention for periods of several
months. The burners are of special construction, provided with a
very thick wick which is in the first instance treated in such a
manner as to cause the formation of a deposit of carbonized tar on its
exposed upper surface. This crust prevents further charring of the
wick after ignition, the oil becoming vaporized from the under side
of the crust. Many fixed, occulting and flashing lights fitted with
these burners are established in France and other countries. In the
case of the occulting types a revolving screen is placed around the
burner and carried upon a miniature mercury float. The rotation is
effected by means of a small Gramme motor on a vertical axis, fitted
with a speed governor, and supplied with current from a battery
of primary cells. The oil reservoir is placed in the upper part of the
lantern and connected with the burner by a tube, to which is fitted
a constant level regulator for maintaining the burning level of the
oil at a fixed height. In the flashing or revolving light types the
arrangement is generally similar, the lenses being revolved upon a
mercury float which is rotated by the electric motor. The flashing
apparatus established at St Marcouf in 1901 has a beam intensity
of 1000 candle-power, and is capable of running unattended for
three months. The electric current employed for rotating the
apparatus is supplied by four Lalande and Chaperon primary cells,
coupled in series, each giving about 0.15 ampere at a voltage of
0.65. The power required to work the apparatus is at the maximum
about 0.165 ampere at 0.75 volt, the large surplus of power which
is provided for the sake of safety being absorbed by a brake or
governor connected with the motor.</p>

<p><i>Wigham Beacon Lights.</i>&mdash;Wigham introduced an oil lamp for
beacon and buoy purposes consisting of a vertical container filled
with ordinary mineral oil or paraffin, and carrying a roller immediately
under the burner case over which a long flat wick passes. One
end of the wick is attached to a float which falls in the container as
the oil is consumed, automatically drawing a fresh portion of the
wick over the roller. The other end of the wick is attached to a free
counterweight which serves to keep it stretched. The oil burns
from the convex surface of the wick as it passes over the roller, a
fresh portion being constantly passed under the action of the flame.
The light is capable of burning without attention for thirty days.
These lights are also fitted with occulting screens on the Lindberg
system. The candle-power of the flame is small.</p>

<p>7. <span class="sc">Light-Vessels.</span>&mdash;The earliest light-vessel placed in English
waters was that at the Nore in 1732. The early light-ships were of
small size and carried lanterns of primitive construction and small
size suspended from the yard-arms. Modern light-vessels are of
steel, wood or composite construction. Steel is now generally
employed in new ships. The wood and composite ships are sheathed
with Muntz metal. The dimensions of English light-vessels vary.
The following may be taken as the usual limits:</p>

</table>

<p class="noind">The larger vessels are employed at outside and exposed stations, the
smaller ships being stationed in sheltered positions and in estuaries.
The moorings usually consist of 3-ton mushroom anchors and
1<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> open link cables. The lanterns in common use are 8 ft. in diameter,
circular in form, with glazing 4 ft. in height. They are
annular in plan, surrounding the mast of the vessel upon which they
are hoisted for illumination, and are lowered to the deck level during
the day. Fixed lanterns mounted on hollow steel masts are now
being used in many services, and are gradually displacing the older
type. The first English light-vessel so equipped was constructed
in 1904. Of the 87 light-vessels in British waters, including unattended
light-vessels, eleven are in Ireland and six in Scotland.
At the present time there are over 750 light-vessels in service throughout
the world.</p>

<p>Until about 1895 the illuminating apparatus used in light-vessels
was exclusively of catoptric form, usually consisting of 21 in. or 24 in.
silvered parabolic reflectors, having 1, 2 or 3-wick mineral oil burners
in focus. The reflectors and lamps are hung in gimbals to preserve
the horizontal direction of the beams.</p>

of a type of reflector in general use:</p>

<p>In revolving flashing lights two or more reflectors are arranged in
parallel in each face. Three, four or more faces or groups of reflectors
are arranged around the lantern in which they revolve, and are
carried upon a turn-table rotated by clockwork. The intensity of
the flashing beam is therefore equivalent to the combined intensities
of the beams emitted by the several reflectors in each face. The first
light-vessel with revolving light was placed at the Swin Middle at
the entrance to the Thames in 1837. Group-flashing characteristics
can be produced by special arrangements of the reflectors. Dioptric
apparatus is now being introduced in many new vessels, the first to
be so fitted in England being that stationed at the Swin Middle in
1905, the apparatus of which is gas illuminated and gives a flash of
25,000 candle-power.</p>

<p>Fog signals, when provided on board light-vessels are generally
in the form of reed-horns or sirens, worked by compressed air. The
compressors are driven from steam or oil engines. The cost of a
modern type of English light-vessel, with power-driven compressed
air siren, is approximately £16,000.</p>

<p>In the United States service, the more recently constructed vessels
have a displacement of 600 tons, each costing £18,000. They are
provided with self-propelling power and steam whistle fog signals.
The illuminating apparatus is usually in the form of small dioptric
lens lanterns suspended at the mast-head&mdash;3 or more to each mast,
but a few of the ships, built since 1907, are provided with fourth-order
revolving dioptric lights in fixed lanterns. There are 53 light-vessels
in service on the coasts of the United States with 13 reserve
ships.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Illumination.</i>&mdash;An experimental installation of the
electric light placed on board a Mersey light-vessel in 1886 by the
Mersey Docks and Harbour Board proved unsuccessful. The
United States Lighthouse Board in 1892 constructed a light-vessel
provided with a powerful electric light, and moored her on the
Cornfield Point station in Long Island Sound. This vessel was
subsequently placed off Sandy Hook (1894) and transferred to the
Ambrose Channel Station in 1907. Five other light-vessels in the
United States have since been provided with incandescent electric
lights&mdash;either with fixed or occulting characteristics&mdash;including
Nantucket Shoals (1896), Fire Island (1897), Diamond Shoals (1898),
Overfalls Shoal (1901) and San Francisco (1902).</p>

<p><i>Gas Illumination.</i>&mdash;In 1896 the French Lighthouse Service completed
the construction of a steel light-vessel (Talais), which was
ultimately placed at the mouth of the Gironde. The construction
of this vessel was the outcome of experiments carried out with a
view to produce an efficient light-vessel at moderate cost, lit by a
dioptric flashing light with incandescent oil-gas burner. The construction
of the Talais was followed by that of a second and larger
vessel, the Snouw, on similar lines, having a length of 65 ft. 6 in.,
beam 20 ft. and a draught of 12 ft., with a displacement of 130 tons.
The cost of this vessel complete with optical apparatus and gasholders,
with accommodation for three men, was approximately
£5000. The vessel was built in 1898-1899.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> A third vessel was
constructed in 1901-1902 for the Sandettié Bank on the general lines
adopted for the preceding examples of her class, but of the following
increased dimensions: length 115 ft.; width at water-line 20 ft. 6 in.;
and draught 15 ft., with a displacement of 342 tons (fig. 47). Accommodation
is provided for a crew of eight men. The optical apparatus
(fig. 48) is dioptric, consisting of 4 panels of 250 mm. focal distance,
carried upon a &ldquo;Cardan&rdquo; joint below the lens table, and counter-balanced
by a heavy pendulum weight. The apparatus is revolved
by clockwork and illuminated by compressed oil gas with
incandescent mantle. The candle-power of the beam is 35,000.
The gas is contained in three reservoirs placed in the hold. The
apparatus is contained in a 6-ft. lantern constructed at the head of
a tubular mast 2 ft. 6 in. diameter. A powerful siren is provided
with steam engine and boiler for working the air compressors. The
total cost of the vessel, including fog signal and optical apparatus,
was £13,600. A vessel of similar construction to the Talais was
placed by the Trinity House in 1905 on the Swin Middle station.
The illuminant is oil gas. Gas illuminated light-vessels have also
been constructed for the German and Chinese Lighthouse Service.</p>

<p><i>Unattended Light-vessels.</i>&mdash;In 1881 an unattended light-vessel,
illuminated with Pintsch&rsquo;s oil gas, was constructed for the Clyde,
and is still in use at the Garvel Point. The light is occulting, and is
shown from a dioptric lens fitted at the head of a braced iron lattice
tower 30 ft. above water-level. The vessel is of iron, 40 ft. long, 12 ft.
beam and 8 ft. deep, and has a storeholder on board containing oil
gas under a pressure of six atmospheres capable of maintaining a
light for three months. A similar vessel is placed off Calshot Spit
in Southampton Water, and several have been constructed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page644" id="page644"></a>644</span>
French and other Lighthouse Services. The French boats are provided
with deep main and bilge keels similar to those adopted in the
larger gas illuminated vessels. In 1901 a light-vessel 60 ft. in
length was placed off the Otter Rock on the west coast of Scotland;
it is constructed of steel, 24 ft. beam, 12 ft. deep and draws 9 ft. of
water (fig. 49). The focal plane is elevated 25 ft. above the water-line,
and the lantern is 6 ft. in diameter. The optical apparatus is
of 500 mm. focal distance and hung in gimbals with a pendulum
balance and &ldquo;Cardan&rdquo; joint as in the Sandettié light-vessel. The
illuminant is oil gas, with an occulting characteristic. The storeholder
contains 10,500 cub. ft. of gas at eight atmospheres, sufficient
to supply the light for ninety days and
nights. A bell is provided, struck by
clappers moved by the roll of the vessel.
The cost of the vessel complete was
£2979. The Northern Lighthouse Commissioners
have four similar vessels in
service, and others have been stationed
in the Hugli estuary, at Bombay, off the
Chinese coasts and elsewhere. In 1909
an unattended gas illuminated light-vessel
provided with a dioptric flashing apparatus
was placed at the Lune Deep in
Morecambe Bay. It is also fitted with
a fog bell struck automatically by a gas
operated mechanism.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Communication of Light-vessels
with the Shore.</i>&mdash;Experiments were instituted
in 1886 at the Sunk light-vessel
off the Essex coast with the view to
maintaining telephonic communication
with the shore by means of a submarine
cable 9 m. in length. Great difficulties
were experienced in maintaining communication
during stormy weather,
breakages in the cable being frequent.
These difficulties were subsequently partially
overcome by the employment of
larger vessels and special moorings.
Wireless telegraphic installations have
now (1910) superseded the cable communications
with light-vessels in English
waters except in four cases. Seven light-vessels,
including the four off the Goodwin
Sands, are now fitted for wireless electrical
communication with the shore.</p>

<p>In addition many pile lighthouses and
isolated rock and island stations have
been placed in electrical communication
with the shore by means of cables or
wireless telegraphy. The Fastnet lighthouse
was, in 1894, electrically connected
with the shore by means of a non-continuous
cable, it being found impossible to maintain a continuous
cable in shallow water near the rock owing to the heavy wash of the
sea. A copper conductor, carried down from the tower to below
low-water mark, was separated from the cable proper, laid on the
bed of the sea in a depth of 13 fathoms, by a distance of about 100 ft.
The lighthouse was similarly connected to earth on the opposite
side of the rock. The conductor terminated in a large copper plate,
and to the cable end was attached a copper mushroom. Weak
currents were induced in the lighthouse conductor by the main
current in the cable, and messages received in the tower by the help
of electrical relays. On the completion of the new tower on the
Fastnet Rock in 1906 this installation was superseded by a wireless
telegraphic installation.</p>

<p>8. <span class="sc">Distribution and Distinction of Lights</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Methods
of Distinction.</i>&mdash;The following are the various light characteristics
which may be exhibited to the mariner:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fixed.</i>&mdash;Showing a continuous or steady light. Seldom used
in modern lighthouses and generally restricted to small port or
harbour lights. A fixed light is liable to be confused with lights
of shipping or other shore lights.</p>

<p><i>Flashing.</i><a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;Showing a single flash, the duration of darkness
always being greater than that of light. This characteristic
or that immediately following is generally adopted for important
lights. The French authorities have given the name <i>Feux-Eclair</i>
to flashing lights of short duration.</p>

<p><i>Group-Flashing.</i>&mdash;Showing groups of two or more flashes in
quick succession (not necessarily of the same colour) separated
by eclipses with a larger interval of darkness between the
groups.</p>

<p><i>Fixed and Flashing.</i>&mdash;Fixed light varied by a single white or
coloured flash, which may be preceded and followed by a short
eclipse. This type of light, in consequence of the unequal
intensities of the beams, is unreliable, and examples are now
seldom installed although many are still in service.</p>

<p><i>Fixed and Group-Flashing.</i>&mdash;Similar to the preceding and open
to the same objections.</p>

<p><i>Revolving.</i>&mdash;This term is still retained in the &ldquo;Lists of Lights&rdquo;
issued by the Admiralty and some other authorities to denote
a light gradually increasing to full effect, then decreasing to
eclipse. At short distances and in clear weather a faint continuous
light may be observed. There is no essential difference between
revolving and flashing lights, the distinction being merely due
to the speed of rotation, and the term might well be abandoned
as in the United States lighthouse list.</p>

<p><i>Occulting.</i>&mdash;A continuous light with, at regular intervals, one
sudden and total eclipse, the duration of light always being equal
to or greater than that of darkness. This characteristic is
usually exhibited by fixed dioptric apparatus fitted with some
form of occulting mechanism. Many lights formerly of fixed
characteristic have been converted to occulting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page645" id="page645"></a>645</span></p>

<p><i>Group Occulting.</i>&mdash;A continuous light with, at regular intervals,
groups of two or more sudden and total eclipses.</p>

<p><i>Alternating.</i>&mdash;Lights of different colours (generally red and
white) alternately without any intervening eclipse. This characteristic
is not to be recommended for reasons which have already
been referred to. Many of the permanent and unwatched lights
on the coasts of Norway and Sweden are of this description.</p>

<p><i>Colour.</i>&mdash;The colours usually adopted for lights are white,
red and green. White is to be preferred whenever possible,
owing to the great absorption of light by the use of red or green
glass screens.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:614px; height:824px" src="images/img645.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;Otter Rock Light-vessel.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Sectors.</i>&mdash;Coloured lights are often requisite to distinguish
cuts or sectors, and should be shown from fixed or occulting light
apparatus and not from flashing apparatus. In marking the
passage through a channel, or between sandbanks or other
dangers, coloured light sectors are arranged to cover the dangers,
white light being shown over the fairway with sufficient margin
of safety between the edges of the coloured sectors next the
fairway and the dangers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Choice of Characteristic and Description of Apparatus.</i>&mdash;In determining
the choice of characteristic for a light due regard must be
paid to existing lights in the vicinity. No light should be placed on
a coast line having a characteristic the same as, or similar to, another
in its neighbourhood unless one or more lights of dissimilar characteristic,
and at least as high power and range, intervene. In the
case of &ldquo;landfall lights&rdquo; the characteristic should differ from any
other within a range of 100 m. In narrow seas the distance between
lights of similar characteristic may be less. Landfall lights are, in
a sense, the most important of all and the most powerful apparatus
available should be installed at such stations. The distinctive
characteristic of a light should be such that it may be readily determined
by a mariner without the necessity of accurately timing the
period or duration of flashes. For landfall and other important
coast stations flashing dioptric apparatus of the first order (920 mm.
focal distance) with powerful burners are required. In countries
where the atmosphere is generally clear and fogs are less prevalent
than on the coasts of the United Kingdom, second or third order lights
suffice for landfalls having regard to the high intensities available
by the use of improved illuminants. Secondary coast lights may be
of second, third or fourth order of flashing character, and important
harbour lights of third or fourth order. Less important harbours
and places where considerable range is not required, as in estuaries
and narrow seas, may be lighted by flashing lights of fourth order or
smaller size. Where sectors are requisite, occulting apparatus should
be adopted for the main light; or subsidiary lights, fixed or occulting,
may be exhibited from the same tower as the main light but at a
lower level. In such cases the vertical distance between
the high and the low light must be sufficient to avoid
commingling of the two beams at any range at which both
lights are visible. Such commingling or blending is due to
atmospheric aberration.</p>

<p><i>Range of Lights.</i>&mdash;The range of a light depends first on its
elevation above sea-level and secondly on its intensity. Most
important lights are of sufficient power to render them
visible at the full geographical range in clear weather. On
the other hand there are many harbour and other lights
which do not meet this condition.</p>

<p>The distances given in lists of lights from which lights are
visible&mdash;except in the cases of lights of low power for the
reason given above&mdash;are usually calculated in nautical miles
as seen from a height of 15 ft. above sea-level, the elevation
of the lights being taken as above high water. Under certain
atmospheric conditions, and especially with the more powerful
lights, the glare of the light may be visible considerably
beyond the calculated range.</p>

<p><i>Elevation of Lights.</i>&mdash;The elevation of the light above sea-level
need not, in the case of landfall lights, exceed 200 ft., which is
sufficient to give a range of over 20 nautical miles. One hundred and
fifty feet is usually sufficient for coast lights. Lights placed on high
headlands are liable to be enveloped in banks of fog at times when at
a lower level the atmosphere is comparatively clear (<i>e.g.</i> Beachy
Head). No definite rule can, however, be laid down, and local
circumstances, such as configuration of the coast line, must be taken
into consideration in every case.</p>

<p><i>Choice of Site.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Landfall&rdquo; stations should receive first consideration
and the choice of location for such a light ought never to be made
subservient to the lighting of the approaches to a port. Subsidiary
lights are available for the latter purpose. Lights installed to guard
shoals, reefs or other dangers should, when practicable, be placed
seaward of the danger itself, as it is desirable that seamen should be
able to &ldquo;make&rdquo; the light with confidence. Sectors marking dangers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page646" id="page646"></a>646</span>
seaward of the light should not be employed except when the danger
is in the near vicinity of the light. Outlying dangers require marking
by a light placed on the danger or by a floating light in its vicinity.</p>

<p>9. <span class="sc">Illuminated Buoys.</span>&mdash;<i>Gas Buoys.</i> Pintsch&rsquo;s oil gas has been
in use for the illumination of buoys since 1878. In 1883 an automatic
occulter was perfected, worked by the gas passing from the reservoir
to the burner. The lights placed on these buoys burn continuously
for three or more months. The buoys and lanterns are made in
various forms and sizes. The spar buoy (fig. 50) may be adopted for
situations where strong tides or currents prevail.
Oil gas lights are frequently fitted to
Courtenay whistling (fig. 51) and bell buoys.</p>

<p>In the ordinary type of gas buoy lantern
the burner employed is of the multiple-jet,
Argand ring, or incandescent type. Incandescent
mantles have been applied to buoy
lights in France with successful results. Since
1906, and more recently the same system of
illumination has been adopted in England
and other countries. The lenses employed
are of cylindrical dioptric fixed-light form,
usually 100 mm. to 300 mm. diameter. Some
of the largest types of gas-buoy in use on the
French coast have an elevation from water
level to the focal plane of over 26 ft. with a
beam intensity of more than 1000 candles.
A large gas-buoy with an elevation of 34 ft.
to the focal plane was placed at the entrance
to the Gironde in 1907. It has an incandescent
burner and exhibits a light of over
1500 candles. Oil gas forms the most trustworthy
and efficient illuminant for buoy purposes
yet introduced, and the system has
been largely adopted by lighthouse and
harbour authorities.</p>

<p>There are now over 2000 buoys fitted with
oil gas apparatus, in addition to 600 beacons,
light-vessels and boats.</p>

<p><i>Electric Lit Buoys.</i>&mdash;Buoys have been
fitted with electric light, both fixed and
occulting. Six electrically lit spar-buoys were
laid down in the Gedney channel, New York
lower bay, in 1888. These were illuminated
by 100 candle-power Swan lamps with continuous
current supplied by cable from a
power station on shore. The wear and tear
of the cables caused considerable trouble and
expense. In 1895 alternating current was
introduced. The installation was superseded
by gas lit buoys in 1904.</p>

<p><i>Acetylene and Oil Lighted Buoys.</i>&mdash;Acetylene
has been extensively employed
for the lighting of buoys in Canada
and in the United States; to a less
extent it has also been adopted in
other countries. Both the low
pressure system, by which the
acetylene gas is produced by an
automatic generator, and the so-called
high pressure system in which
purified acetylene is held in solution
in a high pressure gasholder filled
with asbestos composition saturated
with acetone, have been employed
for illuminating buoys and beacons.
Wigham oil lamps are also used to
a limited extent for buoy lighting.</p>

<p><i>Bell Buoys.</i>&mdash;One form of clapper
actuated by the roll of the buoy
(shown in fig. 52) consists of a
hardened steel ball placed in a horizontal
phosphor-bronze cylinder
provided with rubber buffers.
Three of these cylinders are arranged
around the mouth of the fixed bell,
which is struck by the balls rolling
backwards and forwards as the
buoy moves. Another form of bell
mechanism consists of a fixed bell with three or more
suspended clappers placed externally which strike the
bell when the buoy rolls.</p>

<p class="pt2">10. <span class="sc">Fog Signals.</span>&mdash;The introduction of coast fog
signals is of comparatively recent date. They were, until
the middle of the 19th century, practically unknown
except so far as a few isolated bells and guns were concerned.
The increasing demands of navigation, and the application
of steam power to the propulsion of ships resulting in an increase
of their speed, drew attention to the necessity of providing suitable
signals as aids to navigation during fog and mist. In times
of fog the mariner can expect no certain assistance from even
the most efficient system of coast lighting, since the beams
of light from the most powerful electric lighthouse are frequently
entirely dispersed and absorbed by the particles of moisture, forming
a sea fog of even
moderate density, at
a distance of less
than a ¼ m. from the
shore. The careful
experiments and
scientific research
which have been devoted
to the subject
of coast fog-signalling
have produced
much that is useful
and valuable to the
mariner, but unfortunately
the practical
results so far have
not been so satisfactory
as might be
desired, owing to (1)
the very short range
of the most powerful
signals yet produced
under certain unfavourable
acoustic
conditions of the
atmosphere, (2) the
difficulty experienced
by the mariner
in judging at any
time how far the
atmospheric conditions
are against him
in listening for the
expected signal, and
(3) the difficulty in
locating the position
of a sound signal by
phonic observations.</p>

<p><i>Bells and Gongs</i> are
the oldest and, generally
speaking, the
least efficient forms
of fog signals. Under
very favourable
acoustic conditions the sounds are audible at considerable ranges. On
the other hand, 2-ton bells have been inaudible at distances of a few
hundred yards. The 1893 United States trials showed that a bell
weighing 4000 &#8468; struck by a 450 &#8468; hammer was heard at a distance
of 14 m. across a gentle breeze and at over 9 m. against a 10-knot
breeze. Bells are frequently used for beacon and buoy signals, and
in some cases at isolated rock and other stations where there is
insufficient accommodation for sirens and horns, but their use is
being gradually discontinued in this country for situations where a

powerful signal is required. Gongs, usually of Chinese manufacture,
were formerly in use on board English light-ships and are still used to
some extent abroad. These are being superseded by more powerful
sound instruments.</p>

<p><i>Explosive Signals.</i>&mdash;Guns were long used at many lighthouse and
light-vessel stations in England, and are still in use in Ireland and
at some foreign stations. These are being gradually displaced by
other explosive or compressed air signals. No explosive signals are
in use on the coasts of the United States. In 1878 sound rockets
charged with gun-cotton were first used at Flamborough Head and
were afterwards supplied to many other stations.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The nitrated
gun-cotton or tonite signals now in general use are made up in 4 oz.
charges. These are hung at the end of an iron jib or pole attached
to the lighthouse lantern or other structure, and fired by means of
a detonator and electric battery. The discharge may take place
within 12 ft. of a structure without danger. The cartridges are
stored for a considerable period without deterioration and with
safety. This form of signal is now very generally adopted for rock
and other stations in Great Britain, Canada, Newfoundland, northern
Europe and other parts of the world. An example will be noticed
in the illustration of the Bishop Rock lighthouse, attached to the
lantern (fig. 13). Automatic hoisting and firing appliances are also
in use.</p>

<p><i>Whistles.</i>&mdash;Whistles, whether sounded by air or steam, are not
used in Great Britain, except in two instances of harbour signals
under local control. It has been objected that their sound has too
great a resemblance to steamers&rsquo; whistles, and they are wasteful of
power. In the United States and Canada they are largely used.
The whistle usually employed consists of a metallic dome or bell
against which the high-pressure steam impinges. Rapid vibrations
are set up both in the metal of the bell and in the internal air,
producing a shrill note. The Courtenay buoy whistle, already
referred to, is an American invention and finds favour in the United
States, France, Germany and elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Reed-Horns.</i>&mdash;These instruments in their original form were the
invention of C. L. Daboll, an experimental horn of his manufacture
being tried in 1851 by the United States Lighthouse Board. In 1862
the Trinity House adopted the instrument for seven land and
light-vessel stations. For compressing air for the reed-horns as well as
sirens, caloric, steam, gas and oil engines have been variously used,
according to local circumstances. The reed-horn was improved by
Professor Holmes, and many examples from his designs are now in
use in England and America. At the Trinity House experiments
with fog signals at St Catherine&rsquo;s (1901) several types of reed-horn
were experimented with. The Trinity House service horn uses air
at 15 &#8468; pressure with a consumption of .67 cub. ft. per second and
397 vibrations. A small manual horn of the Trinity House type
consumes .67 cub. ft. of air at 5 &#8468; pressure. The trumpets of the
latter are of brass.</p>

Double-noted Siren.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Sirens.</i>&mdash;The most powerful and efficient of all compressed air fog
signals is the siren. The principle of this instrument may be briefly
explained as follows:&mdash;It
is well known that if the
tympanic membrane is
struck periodically and
with sufficient rapidity by
air impulses or waves a
musical sound is produced.
Robinson was the first to
construct an instrument
by which successive puffs
of air under pressure were
ejected from the mouth of
a pipe. He obtained this
effect by using a stop-cock
revolving at high
speed in such a manner
that 720 pulsations per
second were produced by
the intermittent escape of
air through the valves or
ports, a smooth musical
note being given. Cagniard
de la Tour first gave such
an instrument the name of siren, and constructed it in the form of an
air chamber with perforated lid or cover, the perforations being successively
closed and opened by means of a similarly perforated disk
fitted to the cover and revolving at high speed. The perforations
being cut at an angle, the disk was self-rotated by the oblique pressure
of the air in escaping through the slots. H. W. Dove and Helmholtz
introduced many improvements, and Brown of New York patented,
about 1870, a steam siren with two disks having radial perforations
or slots. The cylindrical form of the siren now generally adopted
is due to Slight, who used two concentric cylinders, one revolving
within the other, the sides being perforated with vertical slots. To
him is also due the centrifugal governor largely used to regulate the
speed of rotation of the siren. Over the siren mouth is placed a
conical trumpet to collect and direct the sound in the desired direction.
In the English service these trumpets are generally of considerable
length and placed vertically, with bent top and bell mouth.
Those at St Catherine&rsquo;s are of cast-iron with copper bell mouth, and
have a total axial length of 22 ft. They
are 5 in. in diameter at the siren mouth,
the bell mouth being 6 ft. in diameter.
At St Catherine&rsquo;s the sirens are two in
number, 5 in. in diameter, being sounded
simultaneously and in unison (fig. 53).
Each siren is provided with ports for
producing a high note as well as a low
note, the two notes being sounded in
quick succession once every minute.
The trumpet mouths are separated by
an angle of 120° between their axes.
This double form has been adopted in
certain instances where the angle desired
to be covered by the sound is comparatively
wide. In Scotland the cylindrical
form is used generally, either
automatically or motor driven. By the
latter means the admission of air to the
siren can be delayed until the cylinder
is rotating at full speed, and a much
sharper sound is produced than in the
case of the automatic type. The Scottish
trumpets are frequently constructed
so that the greater portion of the length
is horizontal. The Girdleness trumpet
has an axial length of 16 ft., 11 ft. 6 in.
being horizontal. The trumpet is capable
of being rotated through an angle as
well as dipped below the horizon. It is
of cast-iron, no bell mouth is used, and
the conical mouth is 4 ft. in diameter.
In France the sirens are cylindrical and
very similar to the English self-driven
type. The trumpets have a short axial
length, 4 ft. 6 in., and are of brass, with bent bell mouth. The
Trinity House has in recent years reintroduced the use of disk
sirens, with which experiments are still being carried out both
in the United Kingdom and abroad. For light-vessels and rock
stations where it is desired to distribute the sound equally in all
directions the mushroom-head trumpet is occasionally used. The
Casquets trumpet of this type is 22 ft. in length, of cast-iron, with
a mushroom top 6 ft. in diameter. In cases where neither the mushroom
trumpet nor the twin siren is used the single bent trumpet is
arranged to rotate through a considerable angle. Table IV. gives
particulars of a few typical sirens of the most recent form.</p>

<p class="pt2">Since the first trial of the siren at the South Foreland in 1873 a
very large number of these instruments have been established both at
lighthouse stations and on board light-vessels. In all cases in Great
Britain and France they are now supplied with air compressed by
steam or other mechanical power. In the United States and some
other countries steam, as well as compressed air, sirens are in use.</p>

<p><i>Diaphones.</i>&mdash;The diaphone is a modification of the siren, which
has been largely used in Canada since 1903 in place of the siren.
It is claimed that the instrument emits a note of more constant pitch
than does the siren. The distinction between the two instruments
is that in the siren a revolving drum or disk alternately opens and
closes elongated air apertures, while in the diaphone a piston pulsating
at high velocity serves to alternately cover and uncover air slots in
a cylinder.</p>

<p><i>The St Catherine&rsquo;s Experiments.</i>&mdash;Extensive trials were carried out
during 1901 by the Trinity House at St Catherine&rsquo;s lighthouse, Isle
of Wight, with several types of sirens and reed-horns. Experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page648" id="page648"></a>648</span>
were also made with different pattern of trumpets, including forms
having elliptical sections, the long axis being placed vertically.
The conclusions of the committee may be briefly summarized as
follows: (1) When a large arc requires to be guarded two fixed
trumpets suitably placed are more effective than one large trumpet
capable of being rotated. (2) When the arc to be guarded is larger
than that effectively covered by two trumpets, the mushroom-head
trumpet is a satisfactory instrument for the purpose. (3) A siren
rotated by a separate motor yields better results than when self-driven.
(4) No advantage commensurate with the additional power
required is obtained by the use of air at a higher pressure than 25 &#8468;
per sq. in. (5) The number of vibrations per second produced by
the siren or reed should be in unison with the proper note of the
associated trumpet. (6) When two notes of different pitch are
employed the difference between these should, if possible, be an
octave. (7) For calm weather a low note is more suitable than a
high note, but when sounding against the wind and with a rough and
noisy sea a high note has the greater range. (8) From causes which
cannot be determined at the time or predicted beforehand, areas
sometimes exist in which the sounds of fog signals may be greatly
enfeebled or even lost altogether. This effect was more frequently
observed during comparatively calm weather and at no great distance
from the signal station. (It has often been observed that the sound
of a signal may be entirely lost within a short distance of the source,
while heard distinctly at a greater distance and at the same time.)
(9) The siren was the most effective signal experimented with; the
reed-horn, although inferior in power, is suitable for situations of
secondary importance. (No explosive signals were under trial
during the experiments.) (10) A fog signal, owing to the uncertainty
attending its audibility, must be regarded only as an auxiliary aid
to navigation which cannot at all times be relied upon.</p>

<p><i>Submarine Bell Signals.</i>&mdash;As early as 1841 J. D. Colladon conducted
experiments on the lake of Geneva to test the suitability of
water as a medium for transmission of sound signals and was able
to convey distinctly audible sounds through water for a distance of
over 21 m., but it was not until 1904 that any successful practical
application of this means of signalling was made in connexion with
light-vessels. There are at present (1910) over 120 submarine bells
in service, principally in connexion with light-vessels, off the coasts
of the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, France
and other countries. These bells are struck by clappers actuated by
pneumatic or electrical mechanism. Other submerged bells have been
fitted to buoys and beacon structures, or placed on the sea bed; in
the former case the bell is actuated by the motion of the buoy and
in others by electric current, transmitted by cable from the shore.
In some cases, when submarine bells are associated with gas buoys or
beacons, the compressed gas is employed to actuate the bell striking
mechanism. To take full advantage of the signals thus provided
it is necessary for ships approaching them to be fitted with special
receiving mechanism of telephonic character installed below the
water line and in contact with the hull plating. The signals are
audible by the aid of ear pieces similar to ordinary telephone receivers.
Not only can the bell signals be heard at considerable distances&mdash;frequently
over 10 m.&mdash;and in all conditions of weather, but the
direction of the bell in reference to the moving ship can be determined
within narrow limits. The system is likely to be widely extended and
many merchant vessels and war ships have been fitted with signal
receiving mechanism.</p>

<p><i>United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;In England the corporation of Trinity House,
or according to its original charter, &ldquo;The Master Wardens, and
Assistants of the Guild Fraternity or Brotherhood of the most
glorious and undivided Trinity and of St Clement, in the Parish of
Deptford Strond, in the county of Kent,&rdquo; existed in the reign of
Henry VII. as a religious house with certain duties connected with
pilotage, and was incorporated during the reign of Henry VIII. In
1565 it was given certain rights to maintain beacons, &amp;c., but not
until 1680 did it own any lighthouses. Since that date it has gradually
purchased most of the ancient privately owned lighthouses and
has erected many new ones. The act of 1836 gave the corporation
control of English coast lights with certain supervisory powers over
the numerous local lighting authorities, including the Irish and
Scottish Boards. The corporation now consists of a Master, Deputy-master,
and 22 Elder Brethren (10 of whom are honorary), together
with an unlimited number of Younger Brethren, who, however,
perform no executive duties. In Scotland and the Isle of Man the
lights are under the control of the Commissioners of Northern
Lighthouses constituted in 1786 and incorporated in 1798. The
lighting of the Irish coast is in the hands of the Commissioners of
Irish Lights formed in 1867 in succession to the old Dublin Ballast
Board. The principal local light boards in the United Kingdom are
the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, and the Clyde Lighthouse
Trustees. The three general lighthouse boards of the United
Kingdom, by the provision of the Mercantile Marine Act of 1854,
are subordinate to the Board of Trade, which controls all finances.</p>

<i>English Colonies.</i>&mdash;In Canada the coast lighting is in the hands of
the minister of marine, and in most other colonies the public works
departments have control of lighthouse matters.</p>

<p><i>Other Countries.</i>&mdash;In Denmark, Austria, Holland, Russia, Sweden,
Norway and many other countries the minister of marine has charge
of the lighting and buoying of coasts; in Belgium the public works
department controls the service.</p>

<p>In the Trinity House Service at shore lighthouse stations there are
usually two keepers, at rock stations three or four, one being ashore
on leave. When there is a fog signal at a station there is usually an
additional keeper, and at electric light stations a mechanical engineer
is also employed as principal keeper. The crews of light-vessels as
a rule consist of 11 men, three of them and the master or mate going
on shore in rotation.</p>

<p>The average annual cost of maintenance of an English shore
lighthouse, with two keepers, is £275. For shore lighthouses with
three keepers and a siren fog signal the average cost is £444. The
maintenance of a rock lighthouse with four keepers and an explosive
fog signal is about £760, and an electric light station costs about
£1100 annually to maintain.</p>

<p>A light-vessel of the ordinary type in use in the United Kingdom
entails an annual expenditure on maintenance of approximately
£1320, excluding the cost of periodical overhaul.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGHTING.<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> Artificial light is generally produced by raising
some body to a high temperature. If the temperature of a
solid body be greater than that of surrounding bodies it parts
with some of its energy in the form of radiation. Whilst the
temperature is low these radiations are not of a kind to which
the eye is sensitive; they are exclusively radiations less refrangible
and of greater wave-length than red light, and may be called
infra-red. As the temperature is increased the infra-red radiations
increase, but presently there are added radiations which
the eye perceives as red light. As the temperature is further
increased, the red light increases, and yellow, green and blue
rays are successively thrown off. On raising the temperature
to a still higher point, radiations of a wave-length shorter even
than violet light are produced, to which the eye is insensitive,
but which act strongly on certain chemical substances; these
may be called ultra-violet rays. Thus a very hot body in general
throws out rays of various wave-length; the hotter the body
the more of every kind of radiation will it throw out, but the
proportion of short waves to long waves becomes vastly greater
as the temperature is increased. Our eyes are only sensitive to
certain of these waves, viz. those not very long and not very
short. The problem of the artificial production of light with
economy of energy is the same as that of raising some body to
such a temperature that it shall give as large a proportion as
possible of those rays which the eye is capable of feeling. For
practical purposes this temperature is the highest temperature
we can produce. As an illustration of the luminous effect of the
high temperature produced by converting other forms of energy
into heat within a small space, consider the following statements.
If burned in ordinary gas burners, 120 cub. ft. of 15 candle gas
will give a light of 360 standard candles for one hour. The heat
produced by the combustion is equivalent to about 60 million
foot-pounds. If this gas be burned in a modern gas-engine,
about 8 million foot-pounds of useful work will be done outside
the engine, or about 4 horse-power for one hour. If this be used
to drive a dynamo for one hour, even if the machine has an
efficiency of only 80%, the energy of the current will be about
6,400,000 foot-pounds per hour, about half of which, or only
3,200,000 foot-pounds, is converted into radiant energy in the
electric arc. But this electric arc will radiate a light of 2000
candles when viewed horizontally, and two or three times as
much when viewed from below. Hence 3 million foot-pounds
changed to heat in the electric arc may be said roughly to
affect our eyes six times as much as 60 million foot-pounds
changed to heat in an ordinary gas burner.</p>

<p>Owing to the high temperature at which it remains solid,
and to its great emissive power, the radiant body used for
artificial illumination is usually some form of carbon. In an
oil or ordinary coal-gas flame this carbon is present in minute
particles derived from the organic substances with which the
flame is supplied and heated to incandescence by the heat
liberated in their decomposition, while in the electric light the
incandescence is the effect of the heat developed by the electric
current passed through a resisting rod or filament of carbon.
In some cases, however, other substances replace carbon as the
radiating body; in the incandescent gas light certain earthy
oxides are utilized, and in metallic filament electric lamps such
metals as tungsten or tantalum.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">1. <span class="sc">Oil Lighting</span></p>

<p>From the earliest times the burning of oil has been a source
of light, but until the middle of the 19th century only oils of
vegetable and animal origin were employed in indoor
lamps for this purpose. Although many kinds were
<span class="sidenote">Vegetable and animal oils.</span>
used locally, only colza and sperm oils had any very
extended use, and they have been practically supplanted
by mineral oil, which was introduced as an illuminant in 1853.
Up to the latter half of the 18th century the lamps were shallow
vessels into which a short length of wick dipped; the flame
was smoky and discharged acrid vapours, giving the minimum
of light with the maximum of smell. The first notable improvement
was made by Ami Argand in 1784. His burner consisted
of two concentric tubes between which the tubular wick was
placed; the open inner tube led a current of air to play upon
the inner surface of the circular flame, whilst the combustion
was materially improved by placing around the flame a chimney
which rested on a perforated gallery a short distance below
the burner. Argand&rsquo;s original burner is the parent form of
innumerable modifications, all more or less complex, such as
the Carcel and the moderator.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A typical example of the Argand burner and chimney is represented
in fig. 1, in which the burner is composed of three tubes,
<i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>. The tube <i>g</i> is soldered to the bottom of the tube <i>d</i>, just
above <i>o</i>, and the interval between the outer surface of the tube <i>g</i>
and the inner surface of the tube <i>d</i> is an annular cylindrical cavity
closed at the bottom, containing the cylindrical cotton wick immersed
in oil. The wick is fixed to the wick tube <i>ki</i>, which is capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page652" id="page652"></a>652</span>
of being moved spirally; within the annular cavity is also the tube
<i>f</i>, which can be moved round, and serves to elevate and depress the
wick. P is a cup that screws on the bottom of the tube <i>d</i>, and receives
the superfluous oil that drops down from the wick along the
inner surface of the tube <i>g</i>. The air
enters through the holes <i>o</i>, <i>o</i>, and
passes up through the tube <i>g</i> to maintain
the combustion in the interior of
the circular flame. The air which
maintains the combustion on the exterior
part of the wick enters through
the holes <i>m</i>, with which rn is perforated.
When the air in the chimney is
rarefied by the heat of the flame, the
surrounding heavier air, entering the
lower part of the chimney, passes upward
with a rapid current, to restore
the equilibrium. RG is the cylindrical
glass chimney with a shoulder or
constriction at R, G. The oil flows
from a side reservoir, and occupies the
cavity between the tubes <i>g</i> and <i>d</i>. The
part <i>ki</i> is a short tube, which receives
the circular wick, and slides spirally on
the tube <i>g</i>, by means of a pin working
in the hollow spiral groove on the exterior
surface of <i>g</i>. The wick-tube has
also a catch, which works in a perpendicular
slit in the tube <i>f</i>; and, by
turning the tube <i>f</i>, the wick-tube will
be raised or lowered, for which purpose
a ring, or gallery, <i>rn</i>, fits on the tube <i>d</i>,
and receives the glass chimney RG; a
wire S is attached to the tube <i>f</i>, and,
bending over, descends along the outside
of <i>d</i>. The part <i>rn</i>, that supports
the glass chimney, is connected by
four other wires with the ring <i>q</i>, which
surrounds the tube <i>d</i>, and can be
moved round. When <i>rn</i> is turned
round, it carries with it the ring <i>q</i>, the
wire S, and the tube <i>f</i>, thus raising or depressing the wick.</p>

<p>A device in the form of a small metallic disk or button, known as
the Liverpool button from having been first adopted in the so-called
Liverpool lamp, effects for the current of air passing up the interior
of the Argand burner the same object as the constriction of the
chimney RG secures in the case of the external tube. The button
fixed on the end of a wire is placed right above the burner tube <i>g</i>,
and throws out equally all round against the flame the current of
air which passes up through <i>g</i>. The result of these expedients,
when properly applied, is the production of an exceedingly solid
brilliant white light, absolutely smokeless, this showing that the
combustion of the oil is perfectly accomplished.</p>

<p>The means by which a uniformly regulated supply of oil is brought
to the burner varies with the position of the oil reservoir. In some
lamps, not now in use, by ring-formed reservoirs and other expedients,
the whole of the oil was
kept as nearly as possible at the
level of the burner. In what are
termed fountain reading, or study
lamps, the principal reservoir is
above the burner level, and various
means are adopted for maintaining
a supply from them at the level of
the burner. But the most convenient
position for the oil reservoir
in lamps for general use is directly
under the burner, and in this case
the stand of the lamp itself is
utilized as the oil vessel. In the
case of fixed oils, as the oils of
animal and vegetable origin used
to be called, it is necessary with
such lamps to introduce some appliance
for forcing a supply of oil to
the burner, and many methods of
effecting this were devised, most of
which were ultimately superseded
by the moderator lamp. The Carcel
or pump lamp, invented by B.
G. Carcel in 1800, is still to some
extent used in France. It consists
of a double piston or pump, forcing the oil through a tube to the
burner, worked by clockwork.</p>

<p>A form of reading lamp still in use is seen in section in fig. 2.
The lamp is mounted on a standard on which it can be raised or
lowered at will, and fixed by a thumb screw. The oil reservoir is
in two parts, the upper <i>ac</i> being an inverted flask which fits into <i>bb</i>,
from which the burner is directly fed through the tube <i>d</i>; <i>h</i> is an
overflow cup for any oil that escapes at the burner, and it is pierced
with air-holes for admitting the current of air to the centre tube of
the Argand burner. The lamp is filled with oil by withdrawing the
flask <i>ac</i>, filling it, and inverting it into its place. The under reservoir
<i>bb</i> fills from it to the burner level <i>ee</i>, on a line with the mouth of <i>ac</i>.
So soon as that level falls below the mouth of <i>ac</i>, a bubble of air
gets access to the upper reservoir, and oil again fills up <i>bb</i> to the
level <i>ee</i>.</p>

<p>The moderator lamp (fig. 3), invented by Franchot about 1836,
from the simplicity and efficiency of its arrangements rapidly
superseded almost all other forms of mechanical lamp for use with
animal and vegetable oils. The two essential features of the moderator
lamp are (1) the strong spiral spring which, acting on a piston
within the cylindrical reservoir of the lamp, serves to propel the oil
to the burner, and (2) the ascending tube C through which the oil
passes upwards to the burner. The latter consist of two sections,
the lower fixed to and passing through the piston A into the oil
reservoir, and the upper attached to the burner. The lower or piston
section moves within the upper, which forms a sheath enclosing
nearly its whole length when the spring is fully wound up. Down
the centre of the upper tube
passes a wire, &ldquo;the moderator,&rdquo;
G, and it is by this wire
that the supply of oil to the
burner is regulated. The
spring exerts its greatest force
on the oil in the reservoir when
it is fully wound up, and in
proportion as it expands and
descends its power decreases.
But when the apparatus is
wound up the wire passing
down the upper tube extends
throughout the whole length
of the lower and narrower
piston tube, obstructing to a
certain extent the free flow of
the oil. In proportion as the
spring uncoils, the length of
the wire within the lower tube
is decreased; the upward flow
of oil is facilitated in the
same ratio as the force urging
it upwards is weakened. In
all mechanical lamps the flow
is in excess of the consuming
capacity of the burner, and
in the moderator the surplus
oil, flowing over the wick,
falls back into the reservoir
above the piston, whence
along with new supply oil it
descends into the lower side by means of leather valves <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>.
B represents the rack which, with the pinion D, winds up the spiral
spring hard against E when the lamp is prepared for use. The
moderator wire is seen separately in GG; and FGC illustrates
the arrangement of the sheathing tubes, in the upper section of
which the moderator is fixed.</p>

<p>As early as 1781 the idea was mooted of burning naphtha,
obtained by the distillation of coal at low temperatures, for
illuminating purposes, and in 1820, when coal gas
was struggling into prominence, light oils obtained
<span class="sidenote">Mineral oils.</span>
by the distillation of coal tar were employed in the
Holliday lamp, which is still the chief factor in illuminating the
street barrow of the costermonger. In this lamp the coal naphtha
is in a conical reservoir, from the apex of which it flows slowly
down through a long metal capillary to a rose burner, which,
heated up by the flame, vaporizes the naphtha, and thus feeds
the ring of small jets of flame escaping from its circumference.</p>

<p>It was in 1847 that James Young had his attention drawn
to an exudation of petroleum in the Riddings Colliery at Alfreton,
in Derbyshire, and found that he could by distillation obtain
from it a lubricant of considerable value. The commercial
success of this material was accompanied by a failure of the
supply, and, rightly imagining that as the oil had apparently
come from the Coal Measures, it might be obtained by distillation
from material of the same character, Young began investigations
in this direction, and in 1850 started distilling oils from a shale
known as the &ldquo;Bathgate mineral,&rdquo; in this way founding the
Scotch oil industry. At first little attention was paid to the
fitness of the oil for burning purposes, although in the early
days at Alfreton Young attempted to burn some of the lighter
distillates in an Argand lamp, and later in a lamp made many
years before for the consumption of turpentine. About 1853,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page653" id="page653"></a>653</span>
however, it was noticed that the lighter distillates were being
shipped to Germany, where lamps fitted for the consumption
of the grades of oil now known as lamp oil were being made by
Stohwasser of Berlin; some of these lamps were imported,
and similar lamps were afterwards manufactured by Laidlaw
in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania in 1859 Colonel E. L. Drake&rsquo;s successful boring
for petroleum resulted in the flooding of the market with oil
at prices never before deemed possible, and led to the introduction
of lamps from Germany for its consumption. Although the first
American patent for a petroleum lamp is dated 1859, that year
saw forty other applications, and for the next twenty years
they averaged about eighty a year.</p>

<p>English lamp-makers were not behind in their attempts to
improve on the methods in use for producing the highest results
from the various grades of oil, and in 1865 Hinks introduced
the duplex burner, while later improvements made in various
directions, by Hinks, Silber, and Defries led to the high degree
of perfection to be found in the lamps of to-day. Mineral oil
for lamps as used in England at the present time may be defined
as consisting of those portions of the distillate from shale oil
or crude petroleum
which have their flash-point
above 73° F., and
which are mobile
enough to be fed by
capillarity in sufficient
quantity to the flame.
The oil placed in the
lamp reservoir is drawn
up by the capillarity of
the wick to the flame,
and being there volatilized,
is converted by
the heat of the burning
flame into a gaseous
mixture of hydrogen
and hydrocarbons,
which is ultimately
consumed by the oxygen of the air and converted into
carbon dioxide and water vapour, the products of complete
combustion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>To secure high illuminating power, together with a smokeless
flame and only products of complete combustion, strict attention
must be paid to several important factors. In the first place, the
wick must be so arranged as to supply the right quantity of oil for
gasification at the burner-head&mdash;the flame must be neither starved
nor overfed: if the former is the case great loss of light is occasioned,
while an excess of oil, by providing more hydrocarbons than the
air-supply to the flame can completely burn, gives rise to smoke
and products of incomplete combustion. The action of the wick
depending on the capillary action of the microscopic tubes forming
the cotton fibre, nothing but long-staple cotton of good quality
should be employed; this should be spun into a coarse loose thread
with as little twist in it as possible, and from this the wick is built
up. Having obtained a wick of soft texture and loose plait, it should
be well dried before the fire, and when put in position in the lamp
must fill the wick-holder without being compressed. It should be
of sufficient length to reach to the bottom of the oil reservoir and
leave an inch or two on the bottom. Such a wick will suck up the
oil in a regular and uniform way, provided that the level of the oil
is not allowed to fall too low in the lamp, but it must be remembered
that the wick acts as a filter for the oil, and that if any sediment
be present it will be retained by and choke the capillaries upon
which the action of the wick depends, so that a wick should not be
used for too long a time. A good rule is that the wick should,
when new, trail for 2 in. on the bottom of the oil vessel, and should
be discarded when these 2 in. have been burnt off.</p>

<p>When the lamp is lighted the oil burns with a heavy, smoky
flame, because it is not able to obtain sufficient oxygen to complete
the combustion, and not only are soot flakes produced, but products
of incomplete combustion, such as carbon monoxide and even
petroleum vapour, escape&mdash;the first named highly injurious to
health, and the second of an offensive odour. To supply the <i>necessary
amount of air</i> to the flame, an artificial draught has to be created
which shall impinge upon the bottom of the flame and sweep upwards
over its surface, giving it rigidity, and by completing the
combustion in a shorter period of time than could be done otherwise,
increasing the calorific intensity and thus raising the carbon particles
in the flame to a far higher incandescence so as to secure a greater
illuminating power. This in practice has been done in two ways,
first by drawing in the air by the up-suck of the heated and expanded
products of combustion in a chimney fitted over the flame, and
secondly by creating a draught from a small clockwork fan in the
base of the lamp. It is necessary to break the initial rush of the
draught: this is mostly effected by disks of perforated metal in
the base of the burner, called <i>diffusers</i>, while the metal dome which
surrounds and rises slightly above the wick-holder serves to deflect
the air on to the flame, as in the Wanzer lamp. These arrangements
also act to a certain extent as regenerators, the air passing over the
heated metal surfaces being warmed before reaching the flame,
whilst disks, cones, buttons, perforated tubes, inner air-tubes, &amp;c.,
have been introduced to increase the illuminating power and complete
the combustion.</p>

<p>According to Sir Boverton Redwood, duplex burners which give
a flame of 28 candle-power have an average oil consumption of
50 grains per candle per hour, while Argand flames of 38 candle-power
consume about 45 grains of oil per candle per hour. These
figures were obtained from lamps of the best types, and to obtain
information as to the efficiency of the lamps used in daily practice,
a number of the most popular types were examined, using both
American and Russian oil. The results obtained are embodied in
Table 1. The first noteworthy point in this table is the apparent
superiority of the American over Russian oil in the majority of
the lamps employed, and there is no doubt that the bulk of the
lamps on the market are constructed to burn American or shale oil.
A second interesting point is that with the flat-flame lamps the
Russian oil is as good as the American. We have Redwood&rsquo;s
authority, moreover, for the fact that after prolonged burning the
Russian oil, even in lamps least suited to it, gives highly improved
results. Although the average consumption with these lamps is
close upon 60 grains per candle with American oil, yet some of the
burners are so manifestly wasteful that 50 grains per candle-power
per hour is the fairest basis to take for any calculation as to cost.</p>

<p>The dangers of the mineral oil lamp, which were a grave drawback
in the past, have been very much reduced by improvements
in construction and quality, and if it were possible to abolish the
cheap and dangerous rubbish sold in poor neighbourhoods, and to
prevent the use of side-fillers and glass reservoirs in lamps of better
quality, a still larger reduction in the number of accidents would
take place. In the use of the lamp for domestic purposes only soft
well-fitting wicks should be employed, and the lamp should be
filled with oil each day so as never to allow it to burn too low and
so leave a large space above the surface of the oil in the reservoir.
The lamp should never be moved whilst alight, and it should only be
put out by means of a proper extinguisher or by blowing across
the top instead of down the chimney. By these means the risk of
accident would be so reduced as to compare favourably with other
illuminants.</p>

<p>Candles, oil and coal gas all emit the same products of complete
combustion, viz. carbon dioxide and water vapour. The quantities
of these compounds emitted from different illuminants for every
candle of light per hour will be seen from the following table:</p>

<p class="noind">From these data it appears that if the sanitary condition of the air
of a dwelling-room be measured by the amount of carbon dioxide
present, as is usually done, candles are the most prejudicial to
health and comfort, oil lamps less so, and gas least, an assumption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page654" id="page654"></a>654</span>
which practical experience does not bear out. The explanation of
this is to be found in these facts: First, where we illuminate a
room with candles or oil we are contented with a less intense and
more local light than when we are using gas, and in a room of ordinary
size would be more likely to use a lamp or two candles than the
far higher illumination we should demand if gas were employed.
Secondly, the amount of water vapour given off during the combustion
of gas is greater than in the case of the other illuminants,
and water vapour absorbing radiant heat from the burning gas
becomes heated, and, diffusing itself about the room, causes great
oppression. Also the air, being highly charged with moisture, is
unable to take up so rapidly the water vapour which is always
evaporating from the surface of our skin, and in this way the functions
of the body receive a slight check, resulting in a feeling of depression.</p>
</div>

<p>A very successful type of oil lamp for use in engineering is
represented by the Lucigen, Doty, and Wells lights, in which the
oil is forced from a reservoir by air-pressure through
a spiral heated by the flame of the lamp, and the heated
<span class="sidenote">Oil-spray lamps.</span>
oil, being then ejected partly as vapour and partly
as spray, burns with a large and highly luminous flame. The
great drawback to these devices is that a certain proportion
of the oil spray escapes combustion and is deposited in the
vicinity of the light. This form of lamp is often used for heating
as well as lighting; the rivets needed for the Forth Bridge
were heated in trays by lamps of this type at the spot where
they were required. The great advantage of these lamps was
that oils of little value could be employed, and the light obtained
approximated to 750 candles per gallon of oil consumed. They
may to a certain extent be looked upon as the forerunners of
perhaps the most successful form of incandescent oil-burner.</p>

<p>As early as 1885 Arthur Kitson attempted to make a burner
for heating purposes on the foregoing principle, <i>i.e.</i> by injecting
oil under pressure from a fine tube into a chamber
where it would be heated by the waste heat escaping
<span class="sidenote">Oil applied to incandescent lighting.</span>
from the flame below, the vapour so produced being
made to issue from a small jet under the pressure
caused by the initial air-pressure and the expansion in the
gasifying tube. This jet of gas was then led into what was
practically an atmospheric burner, and drew in with it sufficient
air to cause its combustion with a non-luminous blue flame
of great heating power. At the time when this was first done
the Welsbach mantle had not yet reached the period of commercial
utility, and attempts were made to use this flame for
the generation of light by consuming it in a mantle of fine
platinum gauze, which, although giving a very fine illuminating
effect during the first few hours, very soon shared the fate of
all platinum mantles&mdash;that is, carbonization of the platinum
surface took place, and destroyed its power of light emissivity.
It was not until 1893 that the perfecting of the Welsbach mantle
enabled this method of consuming the oil to be employed.
The Kitson lamp, and also the Empire lamp on a similar principle,
have given results which ought to ensure their future success,
the only drawback being that they need a certain amount of
intelligent care to keep them in good working order.</p>

<p>Oil gas and oil vapours differ from coal gas merely in the
larger proportion and greater complexity of the hydrocarbon
molecules present, and to render the oil flame available
for incandescent lighting it is only necessary to
<span class="sidenote">Incandescent table-lamps.</span>
cause the oil gas or vapour to become mixed with a
sufficient proportion of air before it arrives at the
point of combustion. But with gases so rich in hydrocarbons
as those developed from oil it is excessively difficult to get
the necessary air intimately and evenly mixed with the gas
in sufficient proportion to bring about the desired result. If
even coal gas be taken and mixed with 2.27 volumes of air,
its luminosity is destroyed, but such a flame would be useless
with the incandescent mantle, as if the non-luminous flame
be superheated a certain proportion of its luminosity will reappear.
When such a flame is used with a mantle the superheating
effect of the mantle itself very quickly leads to the
decomposition of the hydrocarbons and blackening of the
mantle, which not only robs it of its light-giving powers, but
also rapidly ends its life. If, however, the proportion of air
be increased, the appearance of the flame becomes considerably
altered, and the hydrocarbon molecules being burnt up before
impact with the heated surface of the mantle, all chance of
blackening is avoided.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>On the first attempts to construct a satisfactory oil lamp which
could be used with the incandescent mantle, this trouble showed
itself to be a most serious one, as although it was comparatively easy
so to regulate a circular-wicked flame fed by an excess of air as to
make it non-luminous, the moment the mantle was put upon this,
blackening quickly appeared, while when methods for obtaining
a further air supply were devised, the difficulty of producing a flame
which would burn for a considerable time without constant necessity
for regulation proved a serious drawback. This trouble has militated
against most of the incandescent oil lamps placed upon the market.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that if a wick were employed the difficulty
of getting it perfectly symmetrical was a serious matter, and that it
could only be utilized in drawing the oil up to a heating chamber
where it could be volatilized to produce the oil gas, which on then
being mixed with air would give the non-luminous flame. In the
earlier forms of incandescent oil lamps the general idea was to suck
the oil up by the capillarity of a circular wick to a point a short
distance below the opening of the burner at which the flame was
formed, and here the oil was vaporized or gasified by the heat of
the head of the burner. An air supply was then drawn up through
a tube passing through the centre of the wick-tube, while a second
air current was so arranged as to discharge itself almost horizontally
upon the burning gas below the cap, in this way giving a non-luminous
and very hot flame, which if kept very carefully adjusted
afforded excellent results with an incandescent mantle. It was
an arrangement somewhat of this character that was introduced by
the Welsbach Company. The lamps, however, required such careful
attention, and were moreover so irregular in their performance, that
they never proved very successful. Many other forms have reached
a certain degree of perfection, but have not so far attained sufficient
regularity of action to make them commercial successes. One of
the most successful was devised by F. Altmann, in which an ingenious
arrangement caused the vaporization of oil and water by
the heat of a little oil lamp in a lower and separate chamber, and
the mixture of oil gas and steam was then burnt in a burner-head
with a special arrangement of air supply, heating a mantle suspended
above the burner-head.</p>

<p>The perfect petroleum incandescent lamp has not yet been made,
but the results thus obtained show that when the right system
has been found a very great increase in the amount of light developed
from the petroleum may be expected. In one lamp experimented
with for some time it was easy to obtain 3500 candle hours per
gallon of oil, or three times the amount of light obtainable from the
oil when burnt under ordinary conditions.</p>
</div>

<p>Before the manufacture of coal-gas had become so universal
as it is at present, a favourite illuminant for country mansions
and even villages where no coal-gas was available
was a mixture of air with the vapour of very volatile
<span class="sidenote">Air-gas.</span>
hydrocarbons, which is generally known as &ldquo;air-gas.&rdquo; This
was produced by passing a current of dry air through or over
petroleum spirit or the light hydrocarbons distilled from tar,
when sufficient of the hydrocarbon was taken up to give a
luminous flame in flat flame and Argand burners in the same
way as coal-gas, the trouble being that it was difficult to regulate
the amount of hydrocarbon held in suspension by the air, as
this varied very widely with the temperature. As coal-gas
spread to the smaller villages and electric lighting became
utilized in large houses, the use of air-gas died out, but with
the general introduction of the incandescent mantle it again
came to the front. In the earlier days of this revival, air-gas
rich in hydrocarbon vapour was made and was further aerated
to give a non-luminous flame by burning it in an atmospheric
burner.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One of the best illustrations of this system was the Aerogene gas
introduced by A. I. van Vriesland, which was utilized for lighting a
number of villages and railway stations on the continent of Europe.
In this arrangement a revolving coil of pipes continually dips into
petroleum spirit contained in a cylinder, and the air passed into the
cylinder through the coil of pipes becomes highly carburetted by
the time it reaches the outlet at the far end of the cylinder. The
resulting gas when burnt in an ordinary burner gives a luminous
flame; it can be used in atmospheric burners differing little from
those of the ordinary type. With an ordinary Welsbach &ldquo;C&rdquo;
burner it gives a duty of about 30 candles per foot of gas consumed,
the high illuminating power being due to the fact that the gas is
under a pressure of from 6 to 8 in. With such a gas, containing a
considerable percentage of hydrocarbon vapour, any leakage into
the air of a room would give rise to an explosive mixture, in the
same way that coal-gas would do, but inasmuch as mixtures of the
vapour of petroleum spirit and air are only explosive for a very
short range, that is, from 1.25 to 5.3%, some systems have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page655" id="page655"></a>655</span>
introduced in which by keeping the amount of petroleum vapour
at 2% and burning the gas under pressure in a specially constructed
non-aerating mantle burner, not only has it been found possible
to produce a very large volume of gas per gallon of spirit employed,
but the gas is itself non-explosive, increase in the amount of air
taking it farther away from the explosive limit. The Hooker, De
Laitte and several other systems have been based upon this principle.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center">2. <span class="sc">Gas Lighting</span></p>

<p>In all measurements of illuminating value the standard of
comparison used in England is the light yielded by a sperm
candle of the size known as &ldquo;sixes,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> six to the pound,
consuming 120 grains of sperm per hour, and although in photometric
work slight inequalities in burning have led to the candle
being discarded in practice, the standard lamps burning pentane
vapour which have replaced them are arranged to yield a light
of ten candles, and the photometric results are expressed as
before in terms of candles.</p>

<p>When William Murdoch first used coal-gas at his Redruth
home in 1779, he burnt the gas as it escaped from the open
end of a small iron tube, but soon realizing that this plan entailed
very large consumption of gas and gave a very small amount
of light, he welded up the end of his tube and bored three small
holes in it, so arranged that they formed three divergent jets
of flame. From the shape of the flame so produced this burner
received the name of the &ldquo;cockspur&rdquo; burner, and it was the
one used by Murdoch when in 1807 he fitted up an installation
of gas lighting at Phillips &amp; Lee&rsquo;s works in Manchester. This&mdash;the
earliest form of gas burner&mdash;gave an illuminating value of
a little under one candle per cubic foot of gas consumed, and
this duty was slightly increased when the burner was improved
by flattening up the welded end of the tube and making a
series of small holes in line and close together, the jets of flame
from which gave the burner the name of the &ldquo;cockscomb.&rdquo;
It did not need much inventive faculty to replace the line of
holes by a saw-cut, the gas issuing from which burnt in a sheet,
the shape of which led to the burner being called the &ldquo;batswing.&rdquo;
This was followed in 1820 by the discovery of J. B. Neilson,
of Glasgow, whose name is remembered in connexion with the
use of the hot-air blast in iron-smelting, that, by allowing two
flames to impinge upon one another so as to form a flat flame,
a slight increase in luminosity was obtained, and after several
preliminary stages the union jet or &ldquo;fishtail&rdquo; burner was
produced. In this form of burner two holes, bored at the
necessary angle in the same nipple, caused two streams of
gas to impinge upon each other so that they flattened themselves
out into a sheet of flame. The flames given by the batswing
and fishtail burners differed in shape, the former being wide
and of but little height, whilst the latter was much higher and
more narrow. This factor ensured for the fishtail a greater
amount of popularity than the batswing burner had obtained,
as the flame was less affected by draughts and could be used
with a globe, although the illuminating efficiency of the two
burners differed little.</p>

<p>In a lecture at the Royal Institution on the 20th of May
1853, Sir Edward Frankland showed a burner he had devised
for utilizing the heat of the flame to raise the temperature
of the air supply necessary for the combustion
<span class="sidenote">Regenerative burner.</span>
of the gas. The burner was an Argand of the type
then in use, consisting of a metal ring pierced with
holes so as to give a circle of small jets, the ring of flame being
surrounded by a chimney. But in addition to this chimney,
Frankland added a second external one, extending some distance
below the first and closed at the bottom by a glass plate fitted
air-tight to the pillar carrying the burner. In this way the
air needed for the combustion of the gas had to pass down the
space between the two chimneys, and in so doing became highly
heated, partly by contact with the hot glass, and partly by
radiation. Sir Edward Frankland estimated that the temperature
of the air reaching the flame was about 500°F. In 1854
a very similar arrangement was brought forward by the
Rev. W. R. Bowditch, and, as a large amount of publicity was
given to it, the inception of the regenerative burner was
generally ascribed to Bowditch, although undoubtedly due to
Frankland.</p>

<p>The principle of regeneration was adopted in a number of
lamps, the best of which was brought out by Friedrich Siemens
in 1879. Although originally made for heating purposes, the
light given by the burner was so effective and superior to anything
obtained up to that time that it was with some slight
alterations adapted for illuminating purposes.</p>

<p>Improvements followed in the construction and design of the
regenerative lamp, and when used as an overhead burner it was
found that not only was an excellent duty obtained per cubic
foot of gas consumed, but that the lamp could be made a most
efficient engine of ventilation, as an enormous amount of vitiated
air could be withdrawn from the upper part of a room through
a flue in the ceiling space. So marked was the increase in light
due to the regeneration that a considerable number of burners
working on this principle were introduced, some of them like
the Wenham and Cromartie coming into extensive use. They
were, however, costly to <span class="correction" title="amended from instal">install</span>, so that the flat flame burner
retained its popularity in spite of the fact that its duty was
comparatively low, owing to the flame being drawn out into a
thin sheet and so exposed to the cooling influence of the atmosphere.
Almost at the same time that Murdoch was introducing
the cockscomb and cockspur burners, he also made rough forms
of Argand burner, consisting of two concentric pipes between
which the gas was led and burnt with a circular flame. This
form was soon improved by filling in the space between the tubes
with a ring of metal, bored with fine holes so close together that
the jets coalesced in burning and gave a more satisfactory flame,
the air necessary to keep the flame steady and ensure complete
combustion being obtained by the draught created by a chimney
placed around it. When it began to be recognized that the
temperature of the flame had a great effect upon the amount
of light emitted, the iron tips, which had been universally employed,
both in flat flame and Argand burners, were replaced
by steatite or other non-conducting material of similar character,
to prevent as far as possible heat from being withdrawn from
the flame by conduction.</p>

<p>In 1880 the burners in use for coal-gas therefore consisted
of flat flame, Argand, and regenerative burners, and the duty
given by them with a 16-candle gas was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The luminosity of a coal-gas flame depends upon the number
of carbon particles liberated within it, and the temperature to
which they can be heated. Hence the light given by a flame
of coal-gas can be augmented by (1) increasing the number of
the carbon particles, and (2) raising the temperature to which
they are exposed. The first process is carried out by enrichment
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gas</a></span>: <i>Manufacture</i>), the second is best obtained by regeneration,
the action of which is limited by the power possessed by
the material of which burners are composed to withstand the
superheating. Although with a perfectly made regenerative
burner it might be possible for a short time to get a duty as high
as 16 candles per cubic foot from ordinary coal-gas, such a burner
constructed of the ordinary materials would last only a few
hours, so that for practical use and a reasonable life for the
burner 10 candles per cubic foot was about the highest commercial
duty that could be reckoned on. This limitation naturally
caused inventors to search for methods by which the emission
of light could be obtained from coal-gas otherwise than by the
incandescence of the carbon particles contained within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page656" id="page656"></a>656</span>
flame itself. A coal-gas flame consumed in an atmospheric
burner under the conditions necessary to develop its maximum
heating power could be utilized to raise to incandescence particles
having a higher emissivity for light than carbon. This led to the
gradual evolution of incandescent gas lighting.</p>

<p>Long before the birth of the Welsbach mantle it had been
known that when certain unburnable refractory substances
were heated to a high temperature they emitted light,
and Goldsworthy Gurney in 1826 showed that a
<span class="sidenote">Incandescent gas light.</span>
cylinder of lime could be brought to a state of dazzling
brilliancy by the flame of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe,
a fact which was utilized by Thomas Drummond shortly afterwards
in connexion with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. The
mass of a lime cylinder is, however, relatively very considerable,
and consequently an excessive amount of heat has to be brought
to bear upon it, owing to radiation and conduction tending to
dissipate the heat. This is seen by holding in the flame of an
atmospheric burner a coil of thick platinum wire, the result
being that the wire is heated to a dull red only. With wire of
medium thickness a bright red heat is soon attained, and a thin
wire glows with a vivid incandescence, and will even melt in
certain parts of the flame. Attempts were accordingly made
to reduce the mass of the material heated, and this form of
lighting was tried in the streets of Paris, buttons of zirconia and
magnesia being heated by an oxy-coal-gas flame, but the attempt
was soon abandoned owing to the high cost and constant renewals
needed. In 1835 W. H. Fox Talbot discovered that even the
feeble flame of a spirit lamp is sufficient to heat lime to incandescence,
provided the lime be in a sufficiently fine state of
division. This condition he fulfilled by soaking blotting-paper
in a solution of a calcium salt and then incinerating it. Up to
1848, when J. P. Gillard introduced the intermittent process
of making water-gas, the spirit flame and oxy-hydrogen flame
were alone free from carbon particles. Desiring to use the water-gas
for lighting as well as heating purposes Gillard made a mantle
of fine platinum gauze to fit over the flame, and for a time
obtained excellent results, but after a few days the lighting
value of the mantle fell away gradually until it became useless,
owing to the wire becoming eroded on the surface by the flame
gases. This idea has been revived at intervals, but the trouble
of erosion has always led to failure.</p>

<p>The next important stage in the history of gas lighting was
the discovery by R. W. von Bunsen about 1855 of the atmospheric
burner, in which a non-luminous coal-gas flame is obtained by
causing the coal-gas before its combustion to mix with a certain
amount of air. This simple appliance has opened up for coal-gas
a sphere of usefulness for heating purposes as important as its
use for lighting. After the introduction of the atmospheric
burner the idea of the incandescent mantle was revived early
in the eighties by the Clamond basket and a resuscitation of the
platinum mantle. The Clamond basket or mantle, as shown at
the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1882-1883, consisted of a cone
of threads of calcined magnesia. A mixture of magnesium
hydrate and acetate, converted into a paste or cream by means
of water, was pressed through holes in a plate so as to form
threads, and these, after being moulded to the required shape,
were ignited. The heat decomposed the acetate to form a
luting material which glued the particles of magnesium oxide
produced into a solid mass, whilst the hydrate gave off water and
became oxide. The basket was supported with its apex downwards
in a little platinum wire cage, and a mixture of coal-gas
and air was driven into it under pressure from an inverted
blowpipe burner above it.</p>

<p>The Welsbach mantle was suggested by the fact that Auer
von Welsbach had been carrying out researches on the rare
earths, with constant use of the spectroscope. Desiring to
obtain a better effect than that produced by heating his material
on a platinum wire, he immersed cotton in a solution of the
metallic salt, and after burning off the organic matter found
that a replica of the original thread, composed of the oxide of the
metal, was left, and that it glowed brightly in the flame. From
this he evolved the idea of utilizing a fabric of cotton soaked
in a solution of a metallic salt for lighting purposes, and in 1885
he patented his first commercial mantle. The oxides used in
these mantles were zirconia, lanthania, and yttria, but these
were so fragile as to be practically useless, whilst the light they
emitted was very poor. Later he found that the oxide of thorium&mdash;thoria&mdash;in
conjunction with other rare earth oxides, not only
increased the light-giving powers of the mantle, but added
considerably to its strength, and the use of this oxide was protected
by his 1886 patent. Even these mantles were very
unsatisfactory until it was found that the purity of the oxides
had a wonderful effect upon the amount of light, and finally
came the great discovery that it was a trace of ceria in admixture
with the thoria that gave the mantle the marvellous power of
emitting light.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Certain factors limit the number of oxides that can be used in
the manufacture of an incandescent mantle. Atmospheric influences
must not have any action upon them, and they must be sufficiently
refractory not to melt or even soften to any extent at the temperature
of the flame; they must also be non-volatile, whilst the shrinkage
during the process of &ldquo;burning off&rdquo; must not be excessive. The
following table gives the light-emissivity from pure and commercial
samples of the oxides which most nearly conform to the above
requirements; the effect of impurity upon the lighting power will
be seen to be most marked.</p>

<p>Of these oxides thoria, when tested for shrinkage, duration and
strength, stands pre-eminent. It is also possible to employ zirconia
and alumina. Zirconia has the drawback that in the hottest part
of the flame it is liable not only to shrinkage and semi-fusion, but
also to slow volatilization, and the same objections hold good
with respect to alumina. With thoria the shrinkage is smaller than
with any other known substance, and it possesses very high refractory
powers.</p>

<p>The factor which gives thoria its pre-eminence as the basis of the
mantle is that in the conversion of thorium nitrate into thorium oxide
by heat, an enormous expansion takes place, the oxide occupying
more than ten times the volume of the nitrate. This means that the
mass is highly spongy, and contains an enormous number of little
air-cells which must render it an excellent non-conductor. A
mantle made with thoria alone gives practically no light. But the
power of light-emissivity is awakened by the addition of a small
trace of ceria; and careful experiment shows that as ceria is added
to it little by little, the light which the mantle emits grows greater
and greater, until the ratio of 99% of thoria and 1% of ceria is
reached, when the maximum illuminating effect is obtained. The
further addition of ceria causes gradual diminution of light, until,
when with some 10% of ceria has been added, the light given by
the mantle is again almost inappreciable. When cerium nitrate is
converted by heat into cerium oxide, the expansion which takes
place is practically nil, the ceria obtained from a gramme of the
nitrate occupying about the same space as the original nitrate.
Thus, although by weight the ratio of ceria to thoria is as 1:99, by
volume it is only as 1:999.</p>
</div>

<p>The most successful form of mantle is made by taking a
cylinder of cotton net about 8 in. long, and soaking it in a
solution of nitrates of the requisite metals until the
microscopic fibres of the cotton are entirely filled
<span class="sidenote">Manufacture of mantles.</span>
with liquid. A longer soaking is not advantageous,
as the acid nature of the liquid employed tends to
weaken the fabric and render it more delicate to handle. The
cotton is then wrung out to free it from the excess of liquid, and
one end is sewn together with an asbestos thread, a loop of the
same material or of thin platinum wire being fixed across the
constricted portion to provide a support by which the mantle
may be held by the carrying rod, which is either external
to the mantle, or (as is most often the case) fixed centrally in
the burner head. It is then ready for &ldquo;burning off,&rdquo; a process
in which the organic matter is removed and the nitrates are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page657" id="page657"></a>657</span>
converted into oxides. The flame of an atmospheric burner is
first applied to the constricted portion at the top of the mantle,
whereupon the cotton gradually burns downwards, the shape
of the mantle to a great extent depending on the regularity with
which the combustion takes place. A certain amount of carbon
is left behind after the flame has died out, and this is burnt off
by the judicious application of a flame from an atmospheric
blast burner to the interior. The action which takes place
during the burning off is as follows: The cellulose tubes of
the fibre are filled with the crystallized nitrates of the metals
used, and as the cellulose burns the nitrates decompose, giving
up oxygen and forming fusible nitrites, which in their semi-liquid
condition are rendered coherent by the rapid expansion
as the oxide forms. As the action continues the nitrites become
oxides, losing their fusibility, so that by the time the organic
matter has disappeared a coherent thread of oxide is left in place
of the nitrate-laden thread of cotton. In the early days of
incandescent lighting the mantles had to be sent out unburnt,
as no process was known by which the burnt mantle could be
rendered sufficiently strong to bear carriage. As the success
of a mantle depends upon its fitting the flame, and as the burning
off requires considerable skill, this was a great difficulty.
Moreover the acid nature of the nitrates in the fibres rapidly
rotted them, unless they had been subjected to the action of
ammonia gas, which neutralized any excess of acid. It was discovered,
however, that the burnt-off mantle could be temporarily
strengthened by dipping it in collodion, a solution of soluble
gun-cotton in ether and alcohol together with a little castor-oil
or similar material to prevent excessive shrinkage when drying.
When the mantle was removed from the solution a thin film
of solid collodion was left on it, and this could be burned away
when required.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>After the Welsbach mantle had proved itself a commercial success
many attempts were made to evade the monopoly created under
the patents, and, although it was found impossible to get the same
illuminating power with anything but the mixture of 99% thoria
and 1% ceria, many ingenious processes were devised which resulted
in at least one improvement in mantle manufacture. One of
the earliest attempts in this direction was the &ldquo;Sunlight&rdquo; mantle,
in which cotton was saturated with the oxides of aluminium,
chromium and zirconium, the composition of the burnt-off mantle
being:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Alumina</td> <td class="tcr">86.88</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Chromium oxide</td> <td class="tcr">8.68</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcr">100.00</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The light given by these mantles was entirely dependent upon
the proportion of chromium oxides present, the alumina playing
the part of base in the same way that the thoria does in the Welsbach
mantle, the zirconia being added merely to strengthen the structure.
These mantles enjoyed considerable popularity owing to the yellowish
pink light they emitted, but, although they could give an initial
illumination of 12 to 15 candles per foot of gas consumed, they
rapidly lost their light-giving power owing to the slow volatilization
of the oxides of chromium and aluminium.</p>

<p>Another method of making the mantle was first to produce a
basis of thoria, and, having got the fabric in thorium oxide, to coat
it with a mixture of 99% thoria and 1% ceria. This modification
seems to give an improvement in the initial amount of light given
by the mantle. In the Voelker mantle a basis of thoria was produced,
and was then coated by dipping in a substance termed by
the patentee &ldquo;Voelkerite,&rdquo; a body made by fusing together a
number of oxides in the electric furnace. The fused mass was then
dissolved in the strongest nitric acid, and diluted with absolute
alcohol to the necessary degree. A very good mantle having great
lasting power was thus produced. It was claimed that the process
of fusing the materials together in the electric furnace altered the
composition in some unexplained way, but the true explanation is
probably that all water of hydration was eliminated.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Daylight&rdquo; mantle consisted of a basis of thoria or thoria
mixed with zirconia, dipped in collodion containing a salt of cerium
in solution; on burning off the collodion the ceria was left in a
finely divided condition on the surface of the thoria. In this way
a very high initial illuminating power was obtained, which, however,
rapidly fell as the ceria slowly volatilized.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting development of the Welsbach process
was dependent upon the manufacture of filaments of soluble
guncotton or collodion as in the production of artificial silk. In
general the process consisted in forcing a thick solution of the
nitrated cellulose through capillary glass tubes, the bore of which
was less than the one-hundredth of a millimetre. Ten or twelve of
the expressed fibres were then twisted together and wound on a
bobbin, the air of the room being kept sufficiently heated to cause
the drying of the filaments a few inches from the orifice of the tube.
The compound thread was next denitrated to remove its extreme
inflammability, and for this purpose the skeins were dipped in a
solution of (for instance) ammonium sulphide, which converted
them into ordinary cellulose. After washing and drying the skeins
were ready for the weaving machines. In 1894 F. de Mare utilized
collodion for the manufacture of a mantle, adding the necessary
salts to the collodion before squeezing it into threads. O. Knöfler
in 1895, and later on A. Plaissetty, took out patents for the manufacture
of mantles by a similar process to De Mare&rsquo;s, the difference
between the two being that Knöfler used ammonium sulphide for
the denitration of his fabric, whilst Plaissetty employed calcium
sulphide, the objection to which is the trace of lime left in the
material. Another method for making artificial silk which has a
considerable reputation is that known as the Lehner process, which
in its broad outlines somewhat resembles the Chardonnet, but
differs from it in that the excessively high pressures used in the earlier
method are done away with by using a solution of a more liquid
character, the thread being hardened by passing through certain
organic solutions. This form of silk lends itself perhaps better to
the carrying of the salts forming the incandescent oxides than the
previous solutions, and mantles made by this process, known as
Lehner mantles, showed promise of being a most important development
of De Mare&rsquo;s original idea. Mantles made by these processes
show that it is possible to obtain a very considerable increase in life
and light-emissivity, but mantles made on this principle could not
now be sold at a price which would enable them to compete with
mantles of the Welsbach type.</p>

<p>The cause of the superiority of these mantles having been realized,
developments in the required direction were made. The structure
of the cotton mantle differed widely from that obtained by the
various collodion processes, and this alteration in structure was
mainly responsible for the increase in life. Whereas the average of
a large number of Welsbach mantles tested only showed a useful
life of 700 to 1000 hours, the collodion type would average about
1500 hours, some mantles being burnt for an even longer period and
still giving an effective illumination. This being so, it was clear
that one line of advance would be found in obtaining some material
which, whilst giving a structure more nearly approaching that of
the collodion mantle, would be sufficiently cheap to compete with
the Welsbach mantle, and this was successfully done.</p>

<p>By the aid of the microscope the structure of the mantle can be
clearly defined, and in examining the Welsbach mantle before and
after burning, it will be noticed that the cotton thread is a closely
twisted and plaited rope of myriads of minute fibres, whilst the
collodion mantle is a bundle of separate filaments without plait or
heavy twisting, the number of such filaments varying with the process
by which it was made. This latter factor experiment showed
to have a certain influence on the useful light-giving life of the
mantle, as whereas the Knöfler and Plaissetty mantles had an
average life of about 1500 hours, the Lehner fabric, which contained
a larger number of finer threads, could often be burnt continuously
for over 3000 hours, and at the end of that period gave a better light
than most of the Welsbach after as many hundred.</p>

<p>It is well known that plaiting gave the cotton candle-wick that
power of bending over, when freed from the binding effect of the
candle material and influenced by heat, which brought the tip out
from the side of the flame. This, by enabling the air to get at it
and burn it away, removed the nuisance of having to snuff the
candle, which for many centuries has rendered it a tiresome method
of lighting. In the cotton mantle, the tight twisting of the fibre
brings this torsion into play. When the cotton fibres saturated
with the nitrates of the rare metals are burnt off, and the conversion
into oxides takes place, as the cotton begins to burn, not only does
the shrinkage of the mass throw a strain on the oxide skeleton,
but the last struggle of torsion in the burning of the fibre tends
towards disintegration of the fragile mass, and this all plays a part
in making the cotton mantle inferior to the collodion type.</p>

<p>If ramie fibre be prepared in such a way as to remove from it all
traces of the glutinous coating, a silk-like fabric can be obtained
from it, and if still further prepared so as to improve its absorbent
powers, it can be formed into mantles having a life considerably
greater than is possessed by those of the cotton fabric. Ramie
thus seemed likely to yield a cheap competitor in length of endurance
to the collodion mantle, and results have justified this
expectation. By treating the fibre so as to remove the objections
against its use for mantle-making, and then making it into threads
with the least possible amount of twist, a mantle fabric can be made
in every way superior to that given by cotton.</p>

<p>The Plaissetty mantles, which as now manufactured also show a
considerable advance in life and light over the original Welsbach
mantles, are made by impregnating stockings of either cotton or
ramie with the nitrates of thorium and cerium in the usual way,
and, before burning off, mercerizing the mantle by steeping in
ammonia solution, which converts the nitrates into hydrates, and
gives greater density and strength to the finished mantle. The manufacturers
of the Plaissetty mantle have also made a modification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page658" id="page658"></a>658</span>
in the process by which the saturated fabric can be so prepared
as to be easily burnt off by the consumer on the burner on which
it is to be used, in this way doing away with the initial cost of
burning off, shaping, hardening and collodionizing.</p>
</div>

<p>Since 1897 inventions have been patented for methods of
intensifying the light produced by burning gas under a mantle
and increasing the light generated per unit volume
of gas. The systems have either been self-intensifying
<span class="sidenote">Intensifying systems.</span>
or have depended on supplying the gas (or gas and air)
under an increased pressure. Of the self-intensifying
systems those of Lucas and Scott-Snell have been the most
successful. A careful study has been made by the inventor of
the Lucas light of the influence of various sizes and shapes of
chimneys in the production of draught. The specially formed
chimney used exerts a suction on the gas flame and air, and the
burner and mantle are so constructed as to take full advantage
of the increased air supply, with the result that the candle power
given by the mantle is considerably augmented. With the Scott-Snell
system the results obtained are about the same as those
given by the Lucas light, but in this case the waste heat from
the burner is caused to operate a plunger working in the crown
of the lamp which sucks and delivers gas to the burner. Both
these systems are widely used for public lighting in many
large towns of the United Kingdom and the continent of
Europe.</p>

<p>The other method of obtaining high light-power from incandescent
gas burners necessitates the use of some form of motive
power in order to place the gas, or both gas and air, under an
increased pressure. The gas compressor is worked by a water
motor, hot air or gas engine; a low pressure water motor may
be efficiently driven by water from the main, but with large
installations it is more economical to drive the compressor by
a gas engine. To overcome the intermittent flow of gas caused
by the stroke of the engine, a regulator on the floating bell
principle is placed after the compressor; the pressure of gas
in the apparatus governs automatically the flow of gas to the
engine. With the Sugg apparatus for high power lighting the
gas is brought from the district pressure, which is equal to about
2½ in. of water, to an average of 12 in. water pressure. The
light obtained by this system when the gas pressure is 9½ in.
is 300 candle power with an hourly consumption of 10 cub. ft.
of gas, equivalent to 30 candles per cubic foot, and with a gas
pressure equal to 14 in. of water 400 candles are obtained with
an hourly consumption of 12½ cub. ft., which represents a duty
of 32 candles per cubic foot of gas consumed. High pressure
incandescent lighting makes it possible to burn a far larger
volume of gas in a given time under a mantle than is the case
with low pressure lighting, so as to create centres of high total
illuminating value to compete with arc lighting in the illumination
of large spaces, and the Lucas, Keith, Scott-Snell, Millennium,
Selas, and many other pressure systems answer most admirably
for this purpose.</p>

<p>The light given by the ordinary incandescent mantle burning
in an upright position tends rather to the upward direction,
because owing to the slightly conical shape of the
mantle the maximum light is emitted at an angle a
<span class="sidenote">Inverted burners.</span>
little above the horizontal. Inasmuch as for working
purposes the surface that a mantle illuminates is at angles
below 45° from the horizontal, it is evident that a considerable
loss of efficient lighting is brought about, whilst directly under
the light the burner and fittings throw a strong shadow. To
avoid this trouble attempts have from time to time been made
to produce inverted burners which should heat a mantle suspended
below the mouth of the burner. As early as 1882
Clamond made what was practically an inverted gas and air
blowpipe to use with his incandescent basket, but it was not until
1900-1901 that the inverted mantle became a possibility. Although
there was a strong prejudice against it at first, as soon
as a really satisfactory burner was introduced, its success was
quickly placed beyond doubt. The inverted mantle has now
proved itself one of the chief factors in the enormous success
achieved by incandescent mantle lighting, as the illumination
given by it is far more efficient than with the upright mantle,
and it also lends itself well to ornamental treatment.</p>

<p>When the incandescent mantle was first introduced in 1886
an ordinary laboratory Bunsen burner was experimentally
employed, but unless a very narrow mantle just
fitting the top of the tube was used the flame could
<span class="sidenote">Burners.</span>
not be got to fit the mantle, and it was only the extreme outer
edge of the flame which endowed the mantle fabric with the high
incandescent. A wide burner top was then placed on the
Bunsen tube so as to spread the flame, and a larger mantle
became possible, but it was then found that the slowing down
of the rate of flow at the mouth of the burner owing to its enlargement
caused flashing or firing back, and to prevent this a wire
gauze covering was fitted to the burner head; and in this way
the 1886-1887 commercial Welsbach burner was produced.
The length of the Bunsen tube, however, made an unsightly fitting,
so it was shortened, and the burner head made to slip over it,
whilst an external lighting back plate was added. The form of
the &ldquo;C&rdquo; burner thus arrived at has undergone no important
further change. When later on it was desired to make incandescent
mantle burners that should not need the aid of a chimney
to increase the air supply, the long Bunsen tube was reverted
to, and the Kern, Bandsept, and other burners of this class
all have a greater total length than the ordinary burners. To
secure proper mixing of the air and gas, and to prevent flashing
back, they all have heads fitted with baffles, perforations,
gauze, and other devices which oppose considerable resistance
to the flow of the stream of air and gas.</p>

<p>In 1900, therefore, two classes of burner were in commercial
existence for incandescent lighting&mdash;(1) the short burner with
chimney, and (2) the long burner without chimney. Both
classes had the burner mouth closed with gauze or similar device,
and both needed as an essential that the mantle should fit closely
to the burner head.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Prior to 1900 attempts had been made to construct a burner in
which an incandescent mantle should be suspended head downwards.
Inventors all turned to the overhead regenerative gas lamps of the
Wenham type, or the inverted blowpipe used by Clamond, and in
attempting to make an inverted Bunsen employed either artificial
pressure to the gas or the air, or to both, or else enclosed the burner
and mantle in a globe, and by means of a long chimney created a
strong draught. These burners also were all regenerative and aimed
at heating the air or gas or mixture of the two, and they had the
further drawback of being complicated and costly. Regeneration
is a valuable adjunct in ordinary gas lighting as it increases the
actions that liberate the carbon particles upon which the luminosity
of a flame is dependent, and also increases the temperature; but
with the mixture of air and gas in a Bunsen regeneration is not a
great gain when low and is a drawback when intense, because incipient
combination is induced between the oxygen of the air and
the coal-gas before the burner head is reached, the proportions of
air and gas are disturbed, and the flame instead of being non-luminous
shows slight luminosity and tends to blacken the mantle.
The only early attempt to burn a mantle in an inverted position
without regeneration or artificial pressure or draught was made by
H. A. Kent in 1897, and he used, not an inverted Bunsen, but one
with the top elongated and turned over to form a siphon, so that
the point of admixture of air and gas was below the level of the
burner head, and was therefore kept cool and away from the products
of combustion.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1900 J. Bernt and E. Cérvenka set themselves to solve
the problem of making a Bunsen burner which should consume
gas under ordinary gas pressure in an inverted mantle. They
took the short Bunsen burner, as found in the most commonly
used upright incandescent burners, and fitted to it a long tube,
preferably of non-conducting material, which they called an
isolator, and which is designed to keep the flame at a distance
from the Bunsen. They found that it burnt fairly well, and that
the tendency of the flame to burn or lap back was lessened,
but that the hot up-current of heated air and products of combustion
streamed up to the air holes of the Bunsen, and by
contaminating the air supply caused the flame to pulsate.
They then fixed an inverted cone on the isolator to throw the
products of combustion outwards and away from the air holes,
and found that the addition of this &ldquo;deflecting cone&rdquo; steadied
the flame. Having obtained a satisfactory flame, they attacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page659" id="page659"></a>659</span>
the problem of the burner head. Experiments showed that
the burner head must be not only open but also of the same
size or smaller than the burner tube, and that by projecting
it downwards into the mantle and leaving a space between the
mantle and the burner head the maximum mantle surface
heated to incandescence was obtained. It was also found that
the distance which the burner head projects into the mantle
is equivalent to the same amount of extra water pressure on
the gas, and with a long mantle it was found useful under certain
conditions to add a cylinder or sleeve with perforated sides
to carry the gas still lower into the mantle. The principles
thus set forth by Kent, Bernt and Cérvenka form the basis of
construction of all the types of inverted mantle burners which
so greatly increased the popularity of incandescent gas lighting
at the beginning of the 20th century, whilst improvements
in the shape of the mantle for inverted lighting and the methods
of attachment to the burner have added to the success achieved.</p>

<p>The wonderful increase in the amount of light that can be
obtained from gas by the aid of the incandescent gas mantle
is realized when one compares the 1 to 3.2 candles per cubic foot
given by the burners used in the middle of the 19th century with
the duty of incandescent burners, as shown in the following

<p class="pt2 center">3. <span class="sc">Electric Lighting</span>.</p>

<p>Electric lamps are of two varieties: (1) <i>Arc Lamps</i> and
(2) <i>Incandescent</i> or <i>Glow Lamps</i>. Under these headings we
may briefly consider the history, physical principles, and present
practice of the art of electric lighting.</p>

<p>1. <i>Arc Lamps</i>.&mdash;If a voltaic battery of a large number of
cells has its terminal wires provided with rods of electrically-conducting
carbon, and these are brought in contact and then
slightly separated, a form of electric discharge takes place
between them called the <i>electric arc</i>. It is not quite certain
who first observed this effect of the electric current. The statement
that Sir Humphry Davy, in 1801, first produced and
studied the phenomenon is probably correct. In 1808 Davy
had provided for him at the Royal Institution a battery of
2000 cells, with which he exhibited the electric arc on a large
scale.</p>

<p>The electric arc may be produced between any conducting
materials maintained at different potentials, provided that the
source of electric supply is able to furnish a sufficiently large
current; but for illuminating purposes pieces of hard graphitic
carbon are most convenient. If some source of continuous
electric current is connected to rods of such carbon, first brought
into contact and then slightly separated, the following facts
may be noticed: With a low electromotive force of about
50 or 60 volts no discharge takes place until the carbons are
in actual contact, unless the insulation of the air is broken down
by the passage of a small electric spark. When this occurs,
the space between the carbons is filled at once with a flame
or luminous vapour, and the carbons themselves become highly
incandescent at their extremities. If they are horizontal the
flame takes the form of an arch springing between their tips;
hence the name <i>arc</i>. This varies somewhat in appearance
according to the nature of the current, whether continuous
or alternating, and according as it is formed in the open air
or in an enclosed space to which free access of oxygen is prevented.
Electric arcs between metal surfaces differ greatly
in colour according to the nature of the metal. When formed
by an alternating current of high electromotive force they
resemble a lambent flame, flickering and producing a somewhat
shrill humming sound.</p>

<p>Electric arcs may be classified into continuous or alternating
current arcs, and open or enclosed arcs, carbon arcs with pure
or chemically impregnated carbons, or so-called flame arcs,
and arcs formed with metallic or oxide electrodes, such as
magnetite. A continuous current arc is formed with an electric
current flowing always in the same direction; an alternating
current arc is formed with a periodically reversed current. An
open arc is one in which the carbons or other material forming
the arc are freely exposed to the air; an enclosed arc is one
in which they are included in a glass vessel. If carbons impregnated
with various salts are used to colour or increase
the light, the arc is called a chemical or flame arc. The carbons
or electrodes may be arranged in line one above the other, or
they may be inclined so as to project the light downwards
or more in one direction. In a carbon arc if the current is
continuous the positive carbon becomes much hotter at the
end than the negative, and in the open air it is worn away,
partly by combustion, becoming hollowed out at the extremity
into a <i>crater</i>. At the same time the negative carbon gradually
becomes pointed, and also wears away, though much less quickly
than the positive. In the continuous-current open arc the
greater part of the light proceeds from the highly incandescent
positive crater. When the arc is examined through dark glasses,
or by the optical projection of its image upon a screen, a violet
band or stream of vapour is seen to extend between the two
carbons, surrounded by a nebulous golden flame or aureole.
If the carbons are maintained at the right distance apart the
arc remains steady and silent, but if the carbons are impure,
or the distance between them too great, the true electric arc
rapidly changes its place, flickering about and frequently becoming
extinguished; when this happens it can only be restored
by bringing the carbons once more into contact. If the current
is alternating, then the arc is symmetrical, and both carbons
possess nearly the same appearance. If it is enclosed in a
vessel nearly air-tight, the rate at which the carbons are burnt
away is greatly reduced, and if the current is continuous the
positive carbon is no longer cratered out and the negative
no longer so much pointed as in the case of the open arc.</p>

<p>Davy used for his first experiments rods of wood charcoal
which had been heated and plunged into mercury to make
them better conductors. Not until 1843 was it
proposed by J. B. L. Foucault to employ pencils
<span class="sidenote">Carbons.</span>
cut from the hard graphitic carbon deposited in the interior
of gas retorts. In 1846 W. Greener and W. E. Staite patented
a process for manufacturing carbons for this purpose, but
only after the invention of the Gramme dynamo in 1870 any
great demand arose for them. F. P. É. Carré in France in
1876 began to manufacture arc lamp carbons of high quality
from coke, lampblack and syrup. Now they are made by taking
some specially refined form of finely divided carbon, such as the
soot or lampblack formed by cooling the smoke of burning
paraffin or tar, or by the carbonization of organic matter, and
making it into a paste with gum or syrup. This carbon paste
is forced through dies by means of a hydraulic press, the rods
thus formed being subsequently baked with such precautions
as to preserve them perfectly straight. In some cases they
are <i>cored</i>, that is to say, have a longitudinal hole down them,
filled in with a softer carbon. Sometimes they are covered with
a thin layer of copper by electro-deposition. They are supplied
for the market in sizes varying from 4 or 5 to 30 or 40 millimetres
in diameter, and from 8 to 16 in. in length. The value of carbons
for arc lighting greatly depends on their purity and freedom
from ash in burning, and on perfect uniformity of structure.
For ordinary purposes they are generally round in section,
but for certain special uses, such as lighthouse work, they are
made fluted or with a star-shaped section. The positive carbon
is usually of larger section than the negative. For continuous-current
arcs a cored carbon is generally used as a positive,
and a smaller solid carbon as a negative. For flame arc lamps
the carbons are specially prepared by impregnating them with
salts of calcium, magnesium and sodium. The calcium gives
the best results. The rod is usually of a composite type. The
outer zone is pure carbon to give strength, the next zone contains
carbon mixed with the metallic salts, and the inner core
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page660" id="page660"></a>660</span>
is the same but less compressed. In addition to the metallic
salts a flux has to be introduced to prevent the formation of
a non-conducting ash, and this renders it desirable to place
the carbons in a downward pointing direction to get rid of the
slag so formed. Bremer first suggested in 1898 for this purpose
the fluorides of calcium, strontium or barium. When such
carbons are used to form an electric arc the metallic salts deflagrate
and produce a flame round the arc which is strongly
coloured, the object being to produce a warm yellow glow,
instead of the somewhat violet and cold light of the pure carbon
arc, as well as a greater emission of light. As noxious vapours
are however given off, flame arcs can only be used out of doors.
Countless researches have been made on the subject of carbon
manufacture, and the art has been brought to great perfection.</p>

<p>The physical phenomena of the electric arc are best examined
by forming a carbon arc between two carbon rods of the above
description, held in line in a special apparatus, and
arranged so as to be capable of being moved to or from
<span class="sidenote">Physical phenomena.</span>
each other with a slow and easily regulated motion.
An arrangement of this kind is called a <i>hand-regulated
arc lamp</i> (fig. 4). If such an arc lamp is connected to a source
of electric supply having an electromotive force preferably of
100 volts, and if some resistance is included in the circuit, say
about 5 ohms, a steady and continuous arc is formed when the
carbons are brought together and then slightly separated. Its
appearance may be most conveniently examined by projecting
its image upon a screen of white paper by means of an achromatic
lens. A very little examination of the distribution of light from
the arc shows that the illuminating or candle-power is not the
same in different directions. If the carbons are vertical and the
positive carbon is the upper of the two, the illuminating power
is greatest in a direction at an angle inclined about 40 or 50
degrees below the horizon, and at other directions has different
values, which may be represented by the lengths of radial lines
drawn from a centre, the extremities of which define a curve
called the <i>illuminating curve</i> of the arc lamp (fig. 5). Considerable
differences exist between the forms of the illuminating-power
curves of the continuous and alternating current and the open
or enclosed arcs. The chief portion of the emitted light proceeds
from the incandescent crater; hence the form of the illuminating-power
curve, as shown by A. P. Trotter in 1892, is due to the
apparent area of the crater surface which is visible to an eye
regarding the arc in that direction. The form of the illuminating-power
curve varies with the length of the arc and relative size
of the carbons. Leaving out of account for the moment the
properties of the arc as an illuminating agent, the variable
factors with which we are concerned are (i.) the current through
the arc; (ii.) the potential difference of the carbons; (iii.) the
length of the arc; and (iv.) the size of the carbons. Taking in
the first place the typical direct-current arc between solid
carbons, and forming arcs of different lengths and with carbons
of different sizes, it will be found that, beginning at the lowest
current capable of forming a true arc, the potential difference of
the carbons (the arc P.D.) decreases as the current increases.
Up to a certain current strength the arc is silent, but at a particular
critical value P.D. suddenly drops about 10 volts, the current
at the same time rising 2 or 3 amperes. At that moment the
arc begins to <i>hiss</i>, and in this hissing condition, if the current
is still further increased, P.D. remains constant over wide limits.
This drop in voltage on hissing was first noticed by A. Niaudet
(<i>La Lumière électrique</i>, 1881, 3, p. 287). It has been shown
by Mrs Ayrton (<i>Journ. Inst. Elec. Eng.</i> 28, 1899, p. 400) that
the hissing is mainly due to the oxygen which gains access from
the air to the crater, when the latter becomes so large by reason
of the increase of the current as to overspread the end of the
positive carbon. According to A. E. Blondel and Hans Luggin,
hissing takes place whenever the current density becomes greater
than about 0.3 or 0.5 ampere per square millimetre of crater
area.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The relation between the current, the carbon P.D., and the
length of arc in the case of the direct-current arc has been investigated
by many observers with the object of giving it mathematical
expression.</p>

<p>Let V stand for the potential difference of the carbons in volts,
A for the current through the arc in amperes, L for the length of
the arc in millimetres, R for the resistance of the arc; and let
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, &amp;c., be constants. Erik Edlund in 1867, and other workers
after him, considered that their experiments showed that the relation
between V and L could be expressed by a simple linear
equation,</p>

<p class="center">V = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>L.</p>

<p>Later researches by Mrs Ayrton (Electrician, 1898, 41, p. 720),
however, showed that for a direct-current arc of given size with
solid carbons, the observed values of V can be better represented
as a function both of A and of L of the form</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">V = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>L +</td> <td><i>c</i> + <i>d</i>L</td>
<td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">A</td></tr></table>

<p>In the case of direct-current arcs formed with solid carbons,
Edlund and other observers agree that the arc resistance R may be
expressed by a simple straight line law, R = <i>e</i> + <i>f</i>L. If the arc is
formed with cored carbons, Mrs Ayrton demonstrated that the lines
expressing resistance as a function of arc length are no longer
straight, but that there is a rather sudden dip down when the
length of the arc is less than 3 mm.</p>

<p>The constants in the above equation for the potential difference
of the carbons were determined by Mrs Ayrton in the case of solid
carbons to be&mdash;</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">V = 38.9 + 2.07L +</td> <td>11.7 + 10.5L</td>
<td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">A</td></tr></table>

<p>There has been much debate as to the meaning to be given to
the constant <i>a</i> in the above equation, which has a value apparently
not far from forty volts for a direct-current arc with solid carbons.
The suggestion made in 1867 by Edlund (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1868, 36,
p. 358), that it implied the existence of a counter-electromotive
force in the arc, was opposed by Luggin in 1889 (<i>Wien. Ber.</i> 98,
p. 1198), Ernst Lecher in 1888 (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>, 1888, 33, p. 609), and
by Franz Stenger in 1892 (<i>Id.</i> 45, p. 33); whereas Victor von Lang
and L. M. Arons in 1896 (<i>Id.</i> 30, p. 95), concluded that experiment
indicated the presence of a counter-electromotive force of 20 volts.
A. E. Blondel concludes, from experiments made by him in 1897
(<i>The Electrician</i>, 1897, 39, p. 615), that there is no counter-electromotive
force in the arc greater than a fraction of a volt. Subsequently
W. Duddëll (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, 1901, 68, p. 512) described
experiments tending to prove the real existence of a counter-electromotive
force in the arc, probably having a thermo-electric origin,
residing near the positive electrode, and of an associated lesser
adjuvant <i>e.m.f.</i> near the negative carbon.</p>

<p>This fall in voltage between the carbons and the arc is not uniformly
distributed. In 1898 Mrs Ayrton described the results of
experiments showing that if V<span class="su">1</span> is the potential difference between
the positive carbon and the arc, then</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">V<span class="su">1</span> = 31.28 +</td> <td>9 + 3.1L</td>
<td rowspan="2">;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">A</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and if V<span class="su">2</span> is the potential difference between the arc and the negative
carbon, then</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<td rowspan="2">,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">A</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">where A is the current through the arc in amperes and L is the length
of the arc in millimetres.</p>

<p>The total potential difference between the carbons, minus the
fall in potential down the arc, is therefore equal to the sum of
V<span class="su">1</span> + V<span class="su">2</span> = V<span class="su">3</span>.</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">A</td></tr></table>

<p>The difference between this value and the value of V, the total
potential difference between the carbons, gives the loss in potential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page661" id="page661"></a>661</span>
due to the true arc. These laws are simple consequences of straight-line
laws connecting the work spent in the arc at the two electrodes
with the other quantities. If W be the work spent in the arc on
either carbon, measured by the product of the current and the
potential drop in passing from the carbon to the arc, or vice versa,
then for the positive carbon W = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>A, if the length of arc is constant,
W = <i>c</i> + <i>d</i>L, if the current through the arc is constant, and for the
negative carbon W = <i>e</i> + <i>f</i>A.</p>

<p>In the above experiments the potential difference between the
carbons and the arc was measured by using a third exploring carbon
as an electrode immersed in the arc. This method, adopted by
Lecher, F. Uppenborn, S. P. Thompson, and J. A. Fleming, is
open to the objection that the introduction of the third carbon
may to a considerable extent disturb the distribution of potential.</p>

<p>The total work spent in the continuous-current arc with solid
carbons may, according to Mrs Ayrton, be expressed by the
equation</p>

<p class="center">W = 11.7 + 10.5L + (38.9 + 2.07L) A.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the arc, considered as a conductor, has
the property that if the current through it is increased, the difference
of potential between the carbons is decreased, and in one sense,
therefore, the arc may be said to act as if it were a <i>negative resistance</i>.
Frith and Rodgers (<i>Electrician</i>, 1896, 38, p. 75) have suggested that
the resistance of the arc should be measured by the ratio between
a small increment of carbon potential difference and the resulting
small increment of current; in other words, by the equation <i>d</i>V/<i>d</i>A,
and not by the ratio simply of V:A. Considerable discussion has
taken place whether an electrical resistance can have a negative
value, belonging as it does to the class of scalar mathematical
quantities. Simply considered as an electrical conductor, the arc
resembles an intensely heated rod of magnesia or other refractory
oxide, the true resistance of which is decreased by rise of temperature.
Hence an increase of current through such a rod of refractory oxide
is accompanied by a decrease in the potential difference of the ends.
This, however, does not imply a negative resistance, but merely the
presence of a resistance with a negative temperature coefficient.
If we plot a curve such that the ordinates are the difference of
potential of the carbons and the abscissae the current through the
arc for constant length of arc, this curve is now called a <i>characteristic
curve</i> of the arc and its slope at any point the instantaneous resistance
of the arc.</p>
</div>

<p>Other physical investigations have been concerned with
the intrinsic brightness of the crater. It has been asserted
by many observers, such as Blondel, Sir W. de W. Abney, S. P.
Thompson, Trotter, L. J. G. Violle and others, that this is
practically independent of the current passing, but great differences
of opinion exist as to its value. Abney&rsquo;s values lie between
39 and 116, Trotter&rsquo;s between 80 and 170 candles per square
millimetre. Blondel in 1893 made careful determinations of the
brightness of the arc crater, and came to the conclusion that it
was 160 candles per square millimetre. Subsequently J. E.
Petavel found a value of 147 candles per square millimetre for
current densities varying from .06 to .26 amperes per square
millimetre (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, 1899, 65, p. 469). Violle also, in 1893,
supported the opinion that the brightness of the crater per
square millimetre was independent of the current density, and
from certain experiments and assumptions as to the specific
heat of carbon, he asserted the temperature of the crater was
about 3500° C. It has been concluded that this constancy of
temperature, and therefore of brightness, is due to the fact that
the crater is at the temperature of the boiling-point of carbon,
and in that case its temperature should be raised by increasing
the pressure under which the arc works. W. E. Wilson in 1895
attempted to measure the brightness of the crater under various
pressures, and found that under five atmospheres the resistance
of the arc appeared to increase and the temperature of the
crater to fall, until at a pressure of 20 atmospheres the brightness
of the crater had fallen to a dull red. In a later paper Wilson
and G. F. Fitzgerald stated that these preliminary experiments
were not confirmed, and their later researches throw considerable
doubt on the suggestion that it is the boiling-point of carbon
which determines the temperature of the crater. (See <i>Electrician</i>,
1895, 35, p. 260, and 1897, 38, p. 343.)</p>

<p>The study of the alternating-current arc has suggested a
number of new experimental problems for investigators. In
this case all the factors, namely, current, carbon P.D.,
resistance, and illuminating power, are periodically
<span class="sidenote">Alternating current arc.</span>
varying; and as the electromotive force reverses
itself periodically, at certain instants the current
through the arc is zero. As the current can be interrupted for a
moment without extinguishing the arc, it is possible to work
the electric arc from an alternating current generator without
apparent intermission in the light, provided that the frequency
is not much below 50. During the moment that the current
is zero the carbon continues to glow. Each carbon in turn becomes,
so to speak, the crater carbon, and the illuminating
power is therefore symmetrically distributed. The curve of
illumination is as shown in fig. 3. The nature of the variation
of the current and arc P.D. can be examined
by one of two methods, or their
modifications, originally due to Jules
Joubert and A. E. Blondel. Joubert&rsquo;s
method, which has been perfected by many
observers, consists in attaching to the shaft
of the alternator a contact which closes a
circuit at an assigned instant during the
phase. This contact is made to complete
connexion either with a voltmeter or with
a galvanometer placed as a shunt across
the carbons or in series with the arc. By
this arrangement these instruments do not
read, as usual, the root-mean-square value
of the arc P.D. or current, but give a constant indication
determined by, and indicating, the instantaneous values of these
quantities at some assigned instant. By progressive variation
of the phase-instant at which the contact is made, the successive
instantaneous values of the electric quantities can be measured
and plotted out in the form of curves. This method has been
much employed by Blondel, Fleming, C. P. Steinmetz, Tobey
and Walbridge, Frith, H. Görges and many others. The
second method, due to Blondel, depends on the use of the
<i>Oscillograph</i>, which is a galvanometer having a needle or coil
of very small periodic time of vibration, say <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2000</span>th part of a
second or less, so that its deflections can follow the variations
of current passing through the galvanometer. An improved
form of oscillograph, devised by Duddell, consists of two fine
wires, which are strained transversely to the lines of flux of a
strong magnetic field (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oscillograph</a></span>). The current to be
examined is made to pass up one wire and down the other, and
these wires are then slightly displaced in opposite directions.
A small mirror attached to the wires is thus deflected rapidly
to and fro in synchronism with the variations of the current.
From the mirror a ray of light is reflected which falls upon a
photographic plate made to move across the field with a uniform
motion. In this manner a photographic trace can be obtained
of the wave form. By this method the variations of electric
quantities in an alternating-current arc can be watched. The
variation of illuminating power can be followed by examining
and measuring the light of the arc through slits in a revolving
stroboscopic disk, which is driven by a motor synchronously
with the variation of current through the arc.</p>

<p>The general phenomena of the alternating-current arc are
as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If the arc is supplied by an alternator of low inductance, and soft
or cored carbons are employed to produce a steady and silent arc,
the potential difference of the carbons periodically varies in a
manner not very different from that of the alternator on open
circuit. If, however, hard carbons are used, the alternating-current
arc deforms the shape of the alternator electromotive force curve;
the carbon P.D. curve may then have a very different form, and
becomes, in general, more rectangular in shape, usually having a
high peak at the front. The arc also impresses the deformation on
the current curve. Blondel in 1893 (<i>Electrician</i>, 32, p. 161) gave a
number of potential and current curves for alternating-current arcs,
obtained by the Joubert contact method, using two movable coil
galvanometers of high resistance to measure respectively potential
difference and current. Blondel&rsquo;s deductions were that the shape
of the current and volt curves is greatly affected by the nature of
the carbons, and also by the amount of inductance and resistance
in the circuit of the alternator. Blondel, W. E. Ayrton, W. E.
Sumpner and Steinmetz have all observed that the alternating-current
arc, when hissing or when formed with uncored carbons,
acts like an inductive resistance, and that there is a lag between
the current curves and the potential difference curves. Hence the
<i>power-factor</i>, or ratio between the true power and the product of
the root-mean-square values of arc current and carbon potential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page662" id="page662"></a>662</span>
difference, in this case is less than unity. For silent arcs Blondel found
power-factors lying between 0.88 and 0.95, and for hissing ones,
values such as 0.70. Ayrton and Sumpner stated that the power-factor
may be as low as 0.5. Joubert, as far back as 1881, noticed
the deformation which the alternating-current arc impresses upon
the electromotive force curve of an alternator, giving an open
circuit a simple harmonic variation of electromotive force. Tobey
and Walbridge in 1890 gave the results of a number of observations
taken with commercial forms of alternating-current arc lamps, in
which the same deformation was apparent. Blondel in 1896 came
to the conclusion that with the same alternator we can produce
carbon P.D. curves of very varied character, according to the
material of the core, the length of the arc, and the inductance of the
circuit. Hard carbons gave a P.D. curve with a flat top even when
worked on a low inductance alternator.</p>

<p>The periodic variation of light in the alternating-current arc
has also been the subject of inquiry. H. Görges in 1895 at Berlin
applied a stroboscopic method to steady the variations of illuminating
power. Fleming and Petavel employed a similar arrangement,
driving the stroboscopic disk by a synchronous motor (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>,
1896, 41). The light passing through slits of the disk was selected
in one particular period of the phase, and by means of a lens could
be taken from any desired portion of the arc or the incandescent
carbons. The light so selected was measured relatively to the mean
value of the horizontal light emitted by the arc, and accidental
variations were thus eliminated. They found that the light from
any part is periodic, but owing to the slow cooling of the carbons
never quite zero, the minimum value happening a little later
than the zero value of the current. The light emitted by a
particular carbon when it is the negative, does not reach such a large
maximum value as when it is the positive. The same observers
made experiments which seemed to show that for a given expenditure
of power in the arc the alternating current arc in
general gives less mean spherical candle-power than the continuous
current one.</p>

<p>The effect of the wave form on the efficiency of the alternating-current
arc has engaged the attention of many workers. Rössler and
Wedding in 1894 gave an account of experiments with alternating-current
arcs produced by alternators having electromotive force
curves of very different wave forms, and they stated that the efficiency
or mean spherical candle-power per watt expended in the arc
was greatest for the flattest of the three wave forms by nearly 50%.
Burnie in 1897 gave the results of experiments of the same kind.
His conclusion was, that since the light of the arc is a function of
the temperature, that wave form of current is most efficient which
maintains the temperature most uniformly throughout the half
period. Hence, generally, if the current rises to a high value soon
after its commencement, and is preserved at that value, or nearly
at that value, during the phase, the efficiency of the arc will be
greater when the current curve is more pointed or peaked. An
important contribution to our knowledge concerning alternating-current
arc phenomena was made in 1899 by W. Duddell and E. W.
Marchant, in a paper containing valuable results obtained with
their improved oscillograph.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> They studied the behaviour of the
alternating-current arc when formed both with solid carbons, with
cored carbons, and with carbon and metal rods. They found that
with solid carbons the arc P.D. curve is always square-shouldered
and begins with a peak, as shown in fig. 7 (<i>a</i>), but with cored carbons
it is more sinusoidal. Its
shape depends on the
total resistance in the
circuit, but is almost
independent of the type
of alternator, whereas
the current wave form is
largely dependent on the
machine used, and on
the nature and amount
of the impedance in the
circuit; hence the importance
of selecting a suitable alternator for operating alternating-current
arcs. The same observers drew attention to the remarkable
fact that if the arc is formed between a carbon and metal
rod, say a zinc rod, there is a complete interruption of the current
over half a period corresponding to that time during which the
carbon is positive; this suggests that the rapid cooling of the
metal facilitates the flow of the current from it, and resists the
flow of current to it. The dotted curve in fig. 7 (<i>b</i>) shows the current
curve form in the case of a copper rod. By the use of the oscillograph
Duddell and Marchant showed that the hissing continuous-current
arc is intermittent, and that the current is oscillatory and may
have a frequency of 1000 per second. They also showed that
enclosing the arc increases the arc reaction, the front peak of the
potential curve becoming more marked and the power-factor of
the arc reduced.</p>

<p>If a continuous-current electric arc is formed in the open air
with a positive carbon having a diameter of about 15 millimetres,
and a negative carbon having a diameter of about 9
millimetres, and if a current of 10 amperes is employed,
<span class="sidenote">Enclosed arc lamps.</span>
the potential difference between the carbons is generally
from 40 to 50 volts. Such a lamp is therefore called
a 500-watt arc. Under these conditions the carbons each burn
away at the rate of about 1 in. per hour, actual combustion
taking place in the air which gains access to the highly-heated
crater and negative tip; hence the most obvious means of preventing
this disappearance is to enclose the arc in an air-tight glass
vessel. Such a device was tried very early in the history of arc
lighting. The result of using a completely air-tight globe, however,
is that the contained oxygen is removed by combustion with
the carbon, and carbon vapour or hydrocarbon compounds diffuse
through the enclosed space and deposit themselves on the cool
sides of the glass, which is thereby obscured. It was, however,
shown by L. B. Marks (<i>Electrician</i> 31, p. 502, and 38, p. 646)
in 1893, that if the arc is an arc
formed with a small current and
relatively high voltage, namely, 80
to 85 volts, it is possible to admit air
in such small amount that though
the rate of combustion of the carbons
is reduced, yet the air destroys by
oxidation the carbon vapour escaping
from the arc. An arc lamp operated
in this way is called an enclosed arc
lamp (fig. 8). The top of the enclosing
bulb is closed by a gas check plug
which admits through a small hole a
limited supply of air. The peculiarity
of an enclosed arc lamp operated
with a continuous current is that the
carbons do not burn to a crater on the
positive, and a sharp tip or mushroom
on the negative, but preserve nearly
flat surfaces. This feature affects
the distribution of the light. The
illuminating curve of the enclosed
arc, therefore, has not such a strongly
marked maximum value as that of
the open arc, but on the other hand
the true arc or column of incandescent
carbon vapour is less steady in
position, wandering round from place
to place on the surface of the carbons.
As a compensation for this defect, the
combustion of the carbons per hour
in commercial forms of enclosed arc
lamps is about one-twentieth part of that of an open arc lamp
taking the same current.</p>

<p>It was shown by Fleming in 1890 that the column of incandescent
carbon vapour constituting the true arc possesses a unilateral
conductivity (<i>Proc. Roy. Inst.</i> 13, p. 47). If a third carbon is
dipped into the arc so as to constitute a third pole, and if a small
voltaic battery of a few cells, with a galvanometer in circuit,
is connected in between the middle pole and the negative carbon,
it is found that when the negative pole of the battery is in connexion
with the negative carbon the galvanometer indicates
a current, but does not when the positive pole of the battery
is in connexion with the negative carbon of the arc.</p>

<p>Turning next to the consideration of the electric arc as a
source of light, we have already noticed that the illuminating
power in different directions is not the same. If we
imagine an electric arc, formed between a pair of
<span class="sidenote">The arc as an illuminant.</span>
vertical carbons, to be placed in the centre of a hollow
sphere painted white on the interior, then it would be
found that the various zones of this sphere are unequally illuminated.
If the points in which the carbons when prolonged would
intercept the sphere are called the poles, and the line where the
horizontal plane through the arc would intercept the sphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page663" id="page663"></a>663</span>
is called the equator, we might consider the sphere divided
up by lines of latitude into zones, each of which would be
differently illuminated. The total quantity of light or the total
illumination of each zone is the product of the area of the zone
and the intensity of the light falling on the zone measured
in candle-power. We might regard the sphere as uniformly
illuminated with an intensity of light such that the product of
this intensity and the total surface of the sphere was numerically
equal to the surface integral obtained by summing up the products
of the areas of all the elementary zones and the intensity of the
light falling on each. This mean intensity is called the <i>mean
spherical candle-power</i> of the arc. If the distribution of the
illuminating power is known and given by an illumination
curve, the mean spherical candle-power can be at once deduced
(<i>La Lumière électrique</i>, 1890, 37, p. 415).</p>

<p>Owing to the inequality in the distribution of light from an

single number in any other way than by stating the mean spherical
candle-power. All such commonly used expressions as &ldquo;an arc
lamp of 2000 candle-power&rdquo; are, therefore, perfectly meaningless.</p>
</div>

<p>The photometry of arc lamps presents particular difficulties,
owing to the great difference in quality between the light radiated
by the arc and that given by any of the ordinarily
used light standards. (For standards of light and
<span class="sidenote">Photometry of arc.</span>
photometers, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photometer</a></span>.) All photometry
depends on the principle that if we illuminate two
white surfaces respectively and exclusively by two separate
sources of light, we can by moving the lights bring the two
surfaces into such a condition that their <i>illumination</i> or <i>brightness</i>
is the same without regard to any small colour difference. The
quantitative measurement depends on the fact that the illumination
produced upon a surface by a source of light is inversely
as the square of the distance of the source. The trained eye
is capable of making a comparison between two surfaces illuminated
by different sources of light, and pronouncing upon their
equality or otherwise in respect of brightness, apart from a
certain colour difference; but for this to be done with accuracy
the two illuminated surfaces, the brightness of which is to be
compared, must be absolutely contiguous and not separated
by any harsh line. The process of comparing the light from the
arc directly with that of a candle or other similar flame standard
is exceedingly difficult, owing to the much greater proportion
and intensity of the violet rays in the arc. The most convenient
practical working standard is an incandescent lamp run at a
high temperature, that is, at an efficiency of about 2½ watts per
candle. If it has a sufficiently large bulb, and has been <i>aged</i>
by being worked for some time previously, it will at a constant
voltage preserve a constancy in illuminating power sufficiently
long to make the necessary photometric comparisons, and it
can itself be compared at intervals with another standard
incandescent lamp, or with a flame standard such as a Harcourt
pentane lamp.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In measuring the candle-power of arc lamps it is necessary to
have some arrangement by which the brightness of the rays proceeding
from the arc in different directions can be measured. For
this purpose the lamp may be suspended from a support, and a
radial arm arranged to carry three mirrors, so that in whatever
position the arm may be placed, it gathers light proceeding at one
particular angle above or below the horizon from the arc, and this
light is reflected out finally in a constant horizontal direction. An
easily-arranged experiment enables us to determine the constant
loss of light by reflection at all the mirrors, since that reflection
always takes place at 45°. The ray thrown out horizontally can
then be compared with that from any standard source of light by
means of a fixed photometer, and by sweeping round the radial arm
the photometric or illuminating curve of the arc lamp can be obtained.
From this we can at once
determine the nature of
the illumination which
would be produced on a
horizontal surface if the
arc lamp were suspended
at a given distance above
it. Let A (fig. 10) be an
arc lamp placed at a
height <i>h</i>( = AB) above a
horizontal plane. Let ACD
be the illuminating power
curve of the arc, and hence
AC the candle-power in a direction AP. The illumination (I) or
brightness on the horizontal plane at P is equal to</p>

<p class="center">AC cos APM/(AP)<span class="sp">2</span> = FC/(<i>h</i><span class="sp">2</span> + <i>x</i><span class="sp">2</span>), where <i>x</i> = BP.</p>

<p class="noind">Hence if the candle-power curve of the arc and its height above the
surface are known, we can describe a curve BMN, whose ordinate
PM will denote the brightness on the horizontal surface at any
point P. It is easily seen that this ordinate must have a maximum
value at some point. This brightness is best expressed in <i>candle-feet</i>,
taking the unit of illumination to be that given by a standard
candle on a white surface at a distance of 1 ft. If any number
of arc lamps are placed above a horizontal plane, the brightness at
any point can be calculated by adding together the illuminations
due to each respectively.</p>

<p>The process of delineating the photometric or polar curve of
intensity for an arc lamp is somewhat tedious, but the curve has the
advantage of showing exactly the distribution of light in different
directions. When only the mean spherical or mean hemispherical
candle-power is required the process can be shortened by employing
an integrating photometer such as that of C. P. Matthews (<i>Trans.
Amer. Inst. Elec. Eng.</i>, 1903, 19, p. 1465), or the lumen-meter of
A. E. Blondel which enables us to determine at one observation the
total flux of light from the arc and therefore the mean spherical
candle-power per watt.</p>

<p>In the use of arc lamps for street and public lighting, the
question of the distribution of light on the horizontal surface
is all-important. In order that street surfaces may
be well lighted, the minimum illumination should
<span class="sidenote">Street arc lighting.</span>
not fall below 0.1 candle-foot, and in general, in well-lighted
streets, the maximum illumination will be 1 candle-foot
and upwards. By means of an illumination photometer, such
as that of W. H. Preece and A. P. Trotter, it is easy to measure
the illumination in candle-feet at any point in a street surface,
and to plot out a number of contour lines of equal illumination.
Experience has shown that to obtain satisfactory results the
lamps must be placed on a high mast 20 or 25 ft. above the
roadway surface. These posts are now generally made of cast
iron in various ornamental forms (fig. 11), the necessary conductors
for conveying the current up to the lamp being taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page664" id="page664"></a>664</span>
inside the iron mast. (The pair of incandescent lamps halfway
down the standard are for use in the middle of the night,
when the arc lamp would give more light than is
required; they are lighted by an automatic
switch whenever the arc is extinguished.) The
lamp itself is generally enclosed in an opalescent
spherical globe, which is woven over with wire-netting
so that in case of fracture the pieces
may not cause damage. The necessary trimming,
that is, the replacement of carbons, is effected
either by lowering the lamp or, preferably, by
carrying round a portable ladder enabling the
trimmer to reach it. For the purpose of public
illumination it is very usual to employ a lamp
taking 10 amperes, and therefore absorbing
about 500 watts. Such a lamp is called a 500-watt
arc lamp, and it is found that a satisfactory
illumination is given for most street purposes
by placing 500-watt arc lamps at distances
varying from 40 to 100 yds., and at a height
of 20 to 25 ft. above the roadway. The maximum
candle-power of a 500-watt arc enclosed
in a roughened or ground-glass globe will not
exceed 1500 candles, and that of a 6.8-ampere
arc (continuous) about 900 candles. If, however,
the arc is an enclosed arc with double
globes, the absorption of light would reduce the
effective maximum to about 200 c.p. and 120
c.p. respectively. When arc lamps are placed
in public thoroughfares not less than 40 yds.
apart, the illumination anywhere on the street
surface is practically determined by the two
nearest ones. Hence the total illumination at
any point may be obtained by adding together
the illuminations due to each arc separately.
Given the photometric polar curves or illuminating-power
curves of each arc taken outside the
shade or globe, we can therefore draw a curve
representing the resultant illumination on the
horizontal surface. It is obvious that the higher
the lamps are
placed, the more
uniform is the
street surface illumination,
but
the less its average
value; thus
two 10-ampere
arcs placed on
masts 20 ft. above
the road surface
and 100 ft. apart
will give a maximum illumination of about 1.1 and a minimum of
about 0.15 candle-feet in the interspace (fig 12). If the lamps are
raised on 40-ft. posts the maximum illumination will fall to 0.3, and
the minimum will rise to 0.2. For this reason masts have been employed
as high as 90 ft. In docks and railway yards high masts (50
ft.) are an advantage, because the strong contrasts due to shadows
of trucks, carts, &amp;c., then become less marked, but for street
illumination they should not exceed 30 to 35 ft. in height. Taking
the case of 10-ampere and 6.8-ampere arc lamps in ordinary
opal shades, the following figures have been given by Trotter as
indicating the nature of the resultant horizontal illumination:&mdash;</p>

<p>As regards distance apart, a very usual practice is to place
the lamps at spaces equal to six to ten times their height above
the road surface. Blondel (<i>Electrician</i>, 35, p. 846) gives the
following rule for the height (<i>h</i>) of the arc to afford the maximum
illumination at a distance (<i>d</i>) from the foot of the lamp-post,
the continuous current arc being employed:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>These figures show that the distribution of light on the horizontal
surface is greatly affected by the nature of the enclosing
globe. For street illumination naked arcs, although sometimes
employed in works and factory yards, are entirely unsuitable,
since the result produced on the eye by the bright
point of light is to paralyse a part of the retina and contract
the pupil, hence rendering the eye less sensitive when directed
on feebly illuminated surfaces. Accordingly, diffusing globes
have to be employed. It is usual to place the arc in the interior
of a globe of from 12 to 18 in. in diameter. This may be made
of ground glass, opal glass, or be a dioptric globe such as the
holophane. The former two are strongly absorptive, as may
be seen from the results of experiments by Guthrie and Redhead.
The following table shows the astonishing loss of light due to
the use of opal globes:&mdash;</p>

<p>By using Trotter&rsquo;s, Fredureau&rsquo;s or the holophane globe,
the light may be so diffused that the whole globe appears uniformly
luminous, and yet not more than 20% of the light is
absorbed. Taking the absorption of an ordinary opal globe
into account, a 500-watt arc does not usually give more than
500 c.p. as a maximum candle-power. Even with a naked
500-watt arc the mean spherical candle-power is not generally
more than 500 c.p., or at the rate of 1 c.p. per watt. The maximum
candle-power for a given electrical power is, however,
greatly dependent on the current density in the carbon, and
to obtain the highest current density the carbons must be as
thin as possible. (See T. Hesketh, &ldquo;Notes on the Electric
Arc,&rdquo; <i>Electrician</i>, 39, p. 707.)</p>

<p>One early devised form of arc-lamp mechanism was a system of
clockwork driven by a spring or weight, which was started and
stopped by the action of an electromagnet;
in modern lighthouse lamps a similar
mechanism is still employed. W. E. Staite
(1847), J. B. L. Foucault (1849), V. L. M.
Serrin (1857), J. Duboscq (1858), and a host
of later inventors, devised numerous forms of
mechanical and clockwork lamps. The
modern self-regulating type may be said to
have been initiated in 1878 by the differential
lamp of F. von Hefner-Alteneck, and the
clutch lamp of C. F. Brush. The general
principle of the former may be explained as
follows: There are two solenoids, placed
one above the other. The lower one, of
thick wire, is in series with the two carbon
rods forming the arc, and is hence called the
<i>series coil</i>. Above this there is placed another
solenoid of fine wire, which is called the <i>shunt
coil</i>. Suppose an iron rod to be placed so as
to be partly in one coil and partly in another;
then when the coils are traversed by currents,
the iron core will be acted upon by forces
tending to pull it into these solenoids. If
the iron core be attached to one end of a
lever, the other end of which carries the upper
carbon, it will be seen that if the carbons are
in contact and the current is switched on,
the series coil alone will be traversed by the
current, and its magnetic action will draw
down the iron core, and therefore pull the carbons apart and strike
the arc. The moment the carbons separate, there will be a difference
of potential between them, and the shunt coil will then come into
action, and will act on the core so as to draw the carbons together.
Hence the two solenoids act in opposition to each other, one increasing
and the other diminishing the length of the arc, and maintaining
the carbons in the proper position. In the lamp of this
type the upper carbon is in reality attached to a rod having a side-rack
gearing, with a train of wheels governed by a
pendulum. The action of the series coil on the
mechanism is to first lock or stop the train, and
then lift it as a whole slightly. This strikes the
arc. When the arc is too long, the series coil
lowers the gear and finally releases the upper
carbon, so that it can run down by its own weight.
The principle of a shunt and series coil operating
on an iron core in opposition is the basis of the
mechanism of a number of arc lamps. Thus the
lamp invented by F. Krizik and L. Piette, called
from its place of origin the Pilsen lamp, comprises
an iron core made in the shape of a double cone
or spindle (fig. 13), which is so arranged in a brass
tube that it can move into or out of a shunt and
series coil, wound the one with fine and the other
with thick insulated wire, and hence regulate the
position of the carbon attached to it. The movement
of this core is made to feed the carbons
directly without the intervention of any clockwork,
as in the case of the Hefner-Alteneck lamp.
In the clutch-lamp mechanism the lower carbon is
fixed, and the upper carbon rests upon it by its
own weight and that of its holder. The latter
consists of a long rod passing through guides, and
is embraced somewhere by a ring capable of being
tilted or lifted by a finger attached to the armature
of an electromagnet the coils of which are in
series with the arc. When the current passes
through the magnet it attracts the armature, and
by tilting the ring lifts the upper carbon-holder and
hence strikes the arc. If the current diminishes in
value, the upper carbon drops a little by its own
weight, and the feed of the lamp is thus effected
by a series of small lifts and drops of the upper
carbon (fig. 14). Another element sometimes employed
in arc-lamp mechanism is the brake-wheel
regulator. This is a feature of one form of the
Brockie and of the Crompton-Pochin lamps. In
these the movement of the carbons is effected by
a cord or chain which passes over a wheel, or by a
rack geared with the brake wheel. When no current is passing
through the lamp, the wheel is free to move, and the carbons fall
together; but when the current is switched on, the chain or cord
passing over the brake wheel, or the brake wheel itself is gripped
in some way, and at the same time the brake wheel is lifted so that
the arc is struck.</p>

<p>Although countless forms of self-regulating device have been
invented for arc lamps, nothing has survived the test of time
so well as the typical mechanisms which work with carbon rods
in one line, one or both rods being moved by a controlling
apparatus as required. The early forms of semi-incandescent
arc lamp, such as those of R. Werdermann and others, have
dropped out of existence. These were not really true arc lamps,
the light being produced by the incandescence of the extremity
of a thin carbon rod pressed against a larger rod or block. The
once famous Jablochkoff candle, invented in 1876, consisted of
two carbon rods about 4 mm. in diameter, placed parallel to
each other and separated by a partition of kaolin, steatite or
other refractory non-conductor. Alternating currents were
employed, and the candle was set in operation by a match or
starter of high-resistance carbon paste which connected the tips
of the rods. When this burned off, a true arc was formed
between the parallel carbons, the separator volatilizing as the
carbons burned away. Although much ingenuity was expended
on this system of lighting between 1877 and 1881, it no longer
exists. One cause of its disappearance was its relative inefficiency
in light-giving power compared with other forms of carbon arc
taking the same amount of power, and a second equally important
reason was the waste in carbons. If the arc of the
electric candle was accidentally blown out, no means of relighting
existed; hence the great waste in half-burnt candles. H. Wilde,
J. C. Jamin, J. Rapieff and others endeavoured to provide a
remedy, but without success.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is impossible to give here detailed descriptions of a fraction of
the arc-lamp mechanisms devised, and it must suffice to indicate
the broad distinctions between various types. (1) Arc lamps may
be either <i>continuous-current</i> or <i>alternating-current</i> lamps. For
outdoor public illumination the former are greatly preferable, as
owing to the form of the illuminating power-curve they send the
light down on the road surface, provided the upper carbon is the
positive one. For indoor, public room or factory lighting, <i>inverted
arc</i> lamps are sometimes employed. In this case the positive
carbon is the lower one, and the lamp is carried in an inverted
metallic reflector shield, so that the light is chiefly thrown up on
the ceiling, whence it is diffused all round. The alternating-current
arc is not only less efficient in mean spherical candle-power per watt
of electric power absorbed, but its distribution of light is disadvantageous
for street purposes. Hence when arc lamps have to be
worked off an alternating-current circuit for public lighting it is
now usual to make use of a <i>rectifier</i>, which rectifies the alternating
current into an unidirectional though pulsating current. (2.) Arc
lamps may be also classified, as above described, into <i>open</i> or <i>enclosed
arcs</i>. The enclosed arc can be made to burn for 200 hours
with one pair of carbons, whereas open-arc lamps are usually only
able to work, 8, 16 or 32 hours without recarboning, even when
fitted with double carbons. (3) Arc lamps are further divided into
<i>focussing</i> and <i>non-focussing</i> lamps. In the former the lower carbon
is made to move up as the upper carbon moves down, and the arc
is therefore maintained at the same level. This is advisable for arcs
included in a globe, and absolutely necessary in the case of lighthouse
lamps and lamps for optical purposes. (4) Another subdivision is
into <i>hand-regulated</i> and <i>self-regulating</i> lamps. In the hand-regulated
arcs the carbons are moved by a screw attachment as required, as
in some forms of search-light lamp and lamps for optical lanterns.
The carbons in large search-light lamps are usually placed horizontally.
The self-regulating lamps may be classified into groups
depending upon the nature of the regulating appliances. In some
cases the regulation is controlled only by a <i>series coil</i>, and in others
only by a <i>shunt coil</i>. Examples of the former are the original
Gülcher and Brush clutch lamp, and some modern enclosed arc
lamps; and of the latter, the Siemens &ldquo;band&rdquo; lamp, and the
Jackson-Mensing lamp. In series coil lamps the variation of the
current in the coil throws into or out of action the carbon-moving
mechanism; in shunt coil lamps the variation in voltage between
the carbons is caused to effect the same changes. Other types of
lamp involve the use both of shunt and series coils acting against
each other. A further classification of the self-regulating lamps
may be found in the nature of the carbon-moving mechanism.
This may be some modification of the Brush ring clutch, hence
called <i>clutch</i> lamps; or some variety of <i>brake wheel</i>, as employed in
Brockie and Crompton lamps; or else some form of <i>electric motor</i>
is thrown into or out of action and effects the necessary changes.
In many cases the arc-lamp mechanism is provided with a <i>dash-pot</i>,
or contrivance in which a piston moving nearly air-tight in a cylinder
prevents sudden jerks in the motion of the mechanism, and thus
does away with the &ldquo;hunting&rdquo; or rapid up-and-down movements
to which some varieties of clutch mechanism are liable. One very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page666" id="page666"></a>666</span>
efficient form is illustrated in the Thomson lamp and Brush-Vienna
lamp. In this mechanism a shunt and series coil are placed side by
side, and have iron cores suspended to the ends of a rocking arm
held partly within them. Hence, according as the magnetic action
of the shunt or series coil prevails, the rocking arm is tilted backwards
or forwards. When the series coil is not in action the <i>motion</i>
is free, and the upper carbon-holder slides down, or the lower one
slides up, and starts the arc. The series coil comes into action to
withdraw the carbons, and at the same time locks the mechanism.
The shunt coil then operates against the series coil, and between them
the carbon is fed forwards as required. The control to be obtained
is such that the arc shall never become so long as to flicker and
become extinguished, when the carbons would come together again
with a rush, but the feed should be smooth and steady, the position
of the carbons responding quickly to each change in the current.</p>

<p>The introduction of enclosed arc lamps was a great improvement,
in consequence of the economy effected in the consumption of
carbon and in the cost of labour for trimming. A well-known and
widely used form of enclosed arc lamp is the Jandus lamp, which in
large current form can be made to burn for two hundred hours
without recarboning, and in small or midget form to burn for forty
hours, taking a current of two amperes at 100 volts. Such lamps
in many cases conveniently replace large sizes of incandescent
lamps, especially for shop lighting, as they give a whiter light.
Great improvements have also been made in inclined carbon arc
lamps. One reason for the relatively low efficiency of the usual
vertical rod arrangement is that the crater can only radiate laterally,
since owing to the position of the negative carbon no crater light is
thrown directly downwards. If, however, the carbons are placed
in a downwards slanting position at a small angle like the letter V
and the arc formed at the bottom tips, then the crater can emit
downwards all the light it produces. It is found, however, that
the arc is unsteady unless a suitable magnetic field is employed to
keep the arc in position at the carbon tips. This method has been
adopted in the Carbone arc, which, by the employment of inclined
carbons, and a suitable electromagnet to keep the true arc steady
at the ends of the carbons, has achieved considerable success. One
feature of the Carbone arc is the use of a relatively high voltage
between the carbons, their potential difference being as much as
85 volts.</p>
</div>

<p>Arc lamps may be arranged either (i.) in series, (ii.) in parallel
or (iii.) in series parallel. In the first case a number, say 20,
may be traversed by the same current, in that case
supplied at a pressure of 1000 volts. Each must have
<span class="sidenote">Arrangement.</span>
a magnetic cut-out, so that if the carbons stick together
or remain apart the current to the other lamps is not interrupted,
the function of such a cut-out being to close the main circuit
immediately any one lamp ceases to pass current. Arc lamps
worked in series are generally supplied with a current from
a constant current dynamo, which maintains an invariable
current of, say 10 amperes, independently of the number of
lamps on the external circuit. If the lamps, however, are
worked in series off a constant potential circuit, such as one
supplying at the same time incandescent lamps, provision must
be made by which a resistance coil can be substituted for
any one lamp removed or short-circuited. When lamps are
worked in parallel, each lamp is independent, but it is then
necessary to add a resistance in series with the lamp. By
special devices three lamps can be worked in series of 100 volt
circuits. Alternating-current arc lamps can be worked off a
high-tension circuit in parallel by providing each lamp with a
small transformer. In some cases the alternating high-tension
current is <i>rectified</i> and supplied as a unidirectional current to
lamps in series. If single alternating-current lamps have to be
worked off a 100 volt alternating-circuit, each lamp must have
in series with it a choking coil or economy coil, to reduce the
circuit pressure to that required for one lamp. Alternating-current
lamps take a larger <i>effective</i> current, and work with a
less effective or virtual carbon P.D., than continuous current
arcs of the same wattage.</p>

<p>The cost of working public arc lamps is made up of several
items. There is first the cost of supplying the necessary electric
energy, then the cost of carbons and the labour of
recarboning, and, lastly, an item due to depreciation
<span class="sidenote">Cost.</span>
and repairs of the lamps. An ordinary type of open 10 ampere
arc lamp, burning carbons 15 and 9 mm. in diameter for the
positive and negative, and working every night of the year
from dusk to dawn, uses about 600 ft. of carbons per annum.
If the positive carbon is 18 mm. and the negative 12 mm., the
consumption of each size of carbon is about 70 ft. per 1000 hours
of burning. It may be roughly stated that at the present
prices of plain open arc-lamp carbons the cost is about 15s. per
1000 hours of burning; hence if such a lamp is burnt every
night from dusk to midnight the annual cost in that respect is
about £1, 10s. The annual cost of labour per lamp for trimming
is in Great Britain from £2 to £3; hence, approximately speaking,
the cost per annum of maintenance of a public arc lamp burning
every night from dusk to midnight is about £4 to £5, or perhaps
£6, per annum, depreciation and repairs included. Since such
a 10 ampere lamp uses half a Board of Trade unit of electric
energy every hour, it will take 1000 Board of Trade units per
annum, burning every night from dusk to midnight; and if this
energy is supplied, say at 1½d. per unit, the annual cost of energy
will be about £6, and the upkeep of the lamp, including carbons,
labour for trimming and repairs, will be about £10 to £11 per
annum. The cost for labour and carbons is considerably reduced
by the employment of the enclosed arc lamp, but owing to the
absorption of light produced by the inner enclosing globe, and
the necessity for generally employing a second outer globe,
there is a lower resultant candle-power per watt expended in
the arc. Enclosed arc lamps are made to burn without attention
for 200 hours, singly on 100 volt circuits, or two in series on 200
volt circuits, and in addition to the cost of carbons per hour
being only about one-twentieth of that of the open arc, they
have another advantage in the fact that there is a more uniform
distribution of light on the road surface, because a greater
proportion of light is thrown out horizontally.</p>

<p>It has been found by experience that the ordinary type of
open arc lamp with vertical carbons included in an opalescent
globe cannot compete in point of cost with modern improvements
in gas lighting as a means of street illumination. The violet
colour of the light and the sharp shadows, and particularly
the non-illuminated area just beneath the lamp, are grave
disadvantages. The high-pressure flame arc lamp with inclined
chemically treated carbons has, however, put a different complexion
on matters. Although the treated carbons cost more
than the plain carbons, yet there is a great increase of emitted
light, and a 9-ampere flame arc lamp supplied with electric energy
at 1½d. per unit can be used for 1000 hours at an inclusive
cost of about £s to £6, the mean emitted illumination being at
the rate of 4 c.p. per watt absorbed. In the Carbone arc lamp,
the carbons are worked at an angle of 15° or 20° to each other
and the arc is formed at the lower ends. If the potential difference
of the carbons is low, say only 50-60 volts, the crater forms
between the tips of the carbons and is therefore more or less
hidden. If, however, the voltage is increased to 90-100 then
the true flame of the arc is longer and is curved, and the crater
forms at the exteme tip of the carbons and throws all its light
downwards. Hence results a far greater mean hemispherical
candle power (M.H.S.C.P.), so that whereas a 10-ampere 60 volt
open arc gives at most 1200 M.H.S.C.P., a Carbone 10-ampere
85 volt arc will give 2700 M.H.S.C.P. Better results still can be
obtained with impregnated carbons. But the flame arcs with
impregnated carbons cannot be enclosed, so the consumption
of carbon is greater, and the carbons themselves are more
costly, and leave a greater ash on burning; hence more trimming
is required. They give a more pleasing effect for street lighting,
and their golden yellow globe of light is more useful than an
equally costly plain arc of the open type. This improvement
in efficiency is, however, accompanied by some disadvantages.
The flame arc is very sensitive to currents of air and therefore
has to be shielded from draughts by putting it under an &ldquo;economizer&rdquo;
or chamber of highly refractory material which surrounds
the upper carbon, or both carbon tips, if the arc is formed with
inclined carbons. (For additional information on flame arc
lamps see a paper by L. B. Marks and H. E. Clifford, <i>Electrician</i>,
1906, 57, p. 975.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Incandescent Lamps</i>.&mdash;Incandescent electric lighting,
although not the first, is yet in one sense the most obvious
method of utilizing electric energy for illumination. It was
evolved from the early observed fact that a conductor is heated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page667" id="page667"></a>667</span>
when traversed by an electric current, and that if it has a high
resistance and a high melting-point it may be rendered incandescent,
and therefore become a source of light. Naturally
every inventor turned his attention to the employment of
wires of refractory metals, such as platinum or alloys of platinum-iridium,
&amp;c., for the purpose of making an incandescent lamp.
F. de Moleyns experimented in 1841, E. A. King and J. W.
Starr in 1845, J. J. W. Watson in 1853, and W. E. Staite in
1848, but these inventors achieved no satisfactory result. Part
of their want of success is attributable to the fact that the
problem of the economical production of electric current by
the dynamo machine had not then been solved. In 1878 T. A.
Edison devised lamps in which a platinum wire was employed
as the light-giving agent, carbon being made to adhere round
it by pressure. Abandoning this, he next directed his attention
to the construction of an &ldquo;electric candle,&rdquo; consisting of a
thin cylinder or rod formed of finely-divided metals, platinum,
iridium, &amp;c., mixed with refractory oxides, such as magnesia,
or zirconia, lime, &amp;c. This refractory body was placed in a
closed vessel and heated by being traversed by an electric
current. In a further improvement he proposed to use a block
of refractory oxide, round which a bobbin of fine platinum
or platinum-iridium wire was coiled. Every other inventor
who worked at the problem of incandescent lighting seems
to have followed nearly the same path of invention. Long
before this date, however, the notion of employing carbon
as a substance to be heated by the current had entered the
minds of inventors; even in 1845 King had employed a small
rod of plumbago as the substance to be heated. It was obvious,
however, that carbon could only be so heated when in a space
destitute of oxygen, and accordingly King placed his plumbago
rod in a barometric vacuum. S. W. Konn in 1872, and S. A.
Kosloff in 1875, followed in the same direction.</p>

<p>No real success attended the efforts of inventors until it was
finally recognized, as the outcome of the work by J. W. Swan,
T. A. Edison, and, in a lesser degree, St. G. Lane
Fox and W. E. Sawyer and A. Man, that the conditions
<span class="sidenote">Carbon filament lamp.</span>
of success were as follow: First, the substance to
be heated must be carbon in the form of a thin wire
rod or thread, technically termed a <i>filament</i>; second, this must
be supported and enclosed in a vessel formed entirely of glass;
third, the vessel must be exhausted as perfectly as possible;
and fourth, the current must be conveyed into and out of
the carbon filament by means of platinum wires hermetically
sealed through the glass.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One great difficulty was the production of the carbon filament.
King, Sawyer, Man and others had attempted to cut out a suitably
shaped piece of carbon from a solid block; but Edison and Swan
were the first to show that the proper solution of the difficulty was
to carbonize an organic substance to which the necessary form had
been previously given. For this purpose cardboard, paper and
ordinary thread were originally employed, and even, according to
Edison, a mixture of lampblack and tar rolled out into a fine wire
and bent into a spiral. At one time Edison employed a filament
of bamboo, carbonized after being bent into a horse-shoe shape.
Swan used a material formed by treating ordinary crochet cotton-thread
with dilute sulphuric acid, the &ldquo;parchmentized thread&rdquo;
thus produced being afterwards carbonized. In the modern incandescent
lamp the filament is generally constructed by preparing
first of all a form of soluble cellulose. Carefully purified cotton-wool
is dissolved in some solvent, such as a solution of zinc chloride, and
the viscous material so formed is forced by hydraulic pressure
through a die. The long thread thus obtained, when hardened, is
a semi-transparent substance resembling cat-gut, and when carefully
carbonized at a high temperature gives a very dense and elastic
form of carbon filament. It is cut into appropriate lengths, which
after being bent into horse-shoes, double-loops, or any other shape
desired, are tied or folded round carbon formers and immersed in
plumbago crucibles, packed in with finely divided plumbago. The
crucibles are then heated to a high temperature in an ordinary
combustion or electric furnace, whereby the organic matter is
destroyed, and a skeleton of carbon remains. The higher the
temperature at which this carbonization is conducted, the denser
is the resulting product. The filaments so prepared are sorted and
measured, and short leading-in wires of platinum are attached to
their ends by a carbon cement or by a carbon depositing process,
carried out by heating electrically the junction of the carbon and
platinum under the surface of a hydrocarbon liquid. They are then
mounted in bulbs of lead glass having the same coefficient of expansion
as platinum, through the walls of which, therefore, the
platinum wires can be hermetically sealed. The bulbs pass into
the exhausting-room, where they are exhausted by some form of
mechanical or mercury pump. During this process an electric
current is sent through the filament to heat it, in order to disengage
the gases occluded in the carbon, and exhaustion must be so perfect
that no luminous glow appears within the bulb when held in the
hand and touched against one terminal of an induction coil in
operation.</p>

<p>In the course of manufacture a process is generally applied to
the carbon which is technically termed &ldquo;treating.&rdquo; The carbon
filament is placed in a vessel surrounded by an atmosphere of hydrocarbon,
such as coal gas or vapour of benzol. If current is then
passed through the filament the hydrocarbon vapour is decomposed,
and carbon is thrown down upon the filament in the form of a
lustrous and dense deposit having an appearance like steel when
seen under the <span class="correction" title="amended from miscroscope">microscope</span>. This deposited carbon is not only
much more dense than ordinary carbonized organic material, but
it has a much lower specific electric resistance. An untreated carbon
filament is generally termed the primary carbon, and a deposited
carbon the secondary carbon. In the process of treating, the
greatest amount of deposit is at any places of high resistance in
the primary carbon, and hence it tends to cover up or remedy the
defects which may exist. The bright steely surface of a well-treated
filament is a worse radiator than the rougher black surface
of an untreated one; hence it does not require the expenditure of
so much electric power to bring it to the same temperature, and
probably on account of its greater density it ages much less rapidly.</p>

<p>Finally, the lamp is provided with a collar having two sole plates
on it, to which the terminal wires are attached, or else the terminal
wires are simply bent into two loops; in a third form, the Edison
screw terminal, it is provided with a central metal plate, to which
one end of the filament is connected, the other end being joined to
a screw collar. The collars and screws are formed of thin brass
embedded in plaster of Paris, or in some material like vitrite or black
glass (fig. 15). To put the lamp into connexion with the circuit
supplying the current, it has to be fitted into a socket or holder.
Three of the principal types of holder in use are the bottom contact
(<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) or Dornfeld socket, the Edison screw-collar socket and the
Swan or loop socket. In the socket of C. Dornfeld (fig. 16, <i>a</i> and <i>a</i>&prime;)
two spring pistons, in contact with the two sides of the circuit, are
fitted into the bottom of a short metallic tube having bayonet joint
slots cut in the top. The brass collar on the lamp has two pins, by
means of which a bayonet connexion is made between it and the
socket; and when this is done, the spring pins are pressed against
the sole plates on the lamp. In the Edison socket (fig. 16, <i>b</i>) a short
metal tube with an insulating lining has
on its interior a screw sleeve, which is in
connexion with one wire of the circuit;
at the bottom of the tube, and insulated
from the screw sleeve, is a central metal
button, which is in connexion with the
other side of the circuit. On screwing the
lamp into the socket, the screw collar of
the lamp and the boss or plate at the base
of the lamp make contact with the corresponding
parts of the socket, and complete
the connexion. In some cases a form of
switch is included in the socket, which is
then termed the key-holder. For loop
lamps the socket consists of an insulated
block, having on it two little hooks, which
engage with the eyes of the lamp. This
insulating block also carries some form of
spiral spring or pair of spring loops, by
means of which the lamp is pressed away from the socket, and the eyes
kept tight by the hooks. This spring or Swan socket (fig. 16, <i>c</i>) is found
useful in places where the lamps are subject to vibration, for in such
cases the Edison screw collar cannot well be used, because the
vibration loosens the contact of the lamp in the socket. The sockets
may be fitted with appliances for holding ornamental shades or
conical reflectors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page668" id="page668"></a>668</span></p>

<p>The incandescent filament being a very brilliant line of light,
various devices are adopted for moderating its brilliancy and distributing
the light. A simple method is to sand-blast the exterior
of the bulb, whereby it acquires an appearance similar to that of
ground glass, or the bare lamp may be enclosed in a suitable glass
shade. Such shades, however, if made of opalescent or semi-opaque
glass, absorb 40 to 60% of the light; hence various forms
of dioptric shade have been invented, consisting of clear glass ruled
with prismatic grooves in such a manner as to diffuse the light
without any very great absorption. Invention has been fertile in
devising etched, coloured, opalescent, frosted and ornamental
shades for decorative purposes, and in constructing special forms
for use in situations, such as mines and factories for explosives,
where the globe containing the lamp must be air-tight. High
candle-power lamps, 500, 1000 and upwards, are made by placing
in one large glass bulb a number of carbon filaments arranged in
parallel between two rings, which are connected with the main
leading-in wires. When incandescent lamps are used for optical
purposes it is necessary to compress the filament into a small
space, so as to bring it into the focus of a lens or mirror. The filament
is then coiled or crumpled up into a spiral or zigzag form.
Such lamps are called <i>focus lamps</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Incandescent lamps are technically divided into high and
low voltage lamps, high and low efficiency lamps, standard
and fancy lamps. The difference between high and
low efficiency lamps is based upon the relation of the
<span class="sidenote">Classification of lamps.</span>
power absorbed by the lamp to the candle-power
emitted. Every lamp when manufactured is marked
with a certain figure, called the <i>marked volts</i>. This is understood
to be the electromotive force in volts which must be applied
to the lamp terminals to produce through the filament a current
of such magnitude that the lamp will have a practically satisfactory
life, and give in a horizontal direction a certain candle-power,
which is also marked upon the glass. The numerical
product of the current in amperes passing through the lamp,
and the difference in potential of the terminals measured in
volts, gives the total power taken up by the lamp in watts;
and this number divided by the candle-power of the lamp
(taking generally a horizontal direction) gives the <i>watts per
candle-power</i>. This is an important figure, because it is determined
by the temperature; it therefore determines the quality
of the light emitted by the lamp, and also fixes the average
duration of the filament when rendered incandescent by a
current. Even in a good vacuum the filament is not permanent.
Apart altogether from accidental defects, the carbon is slowly
volatilized, and carbon molecules are also projected in straight
lines from different portions of the filament. This process not
only causes a change in the nature of the surface of the filament,
but also a deposit of carbon on the interior of the bulb, whereby
the glass is blackened and the candle-power of the lamp reduced.
The volatilization increases very rapidly as the temperature
rises. Hence at points of high resistance in the filament, more
heat being generated, a higher temperature is attained, and the
scattering of the carbon becomes very rapid; in such cases the
filament is sooner or later cut through at the point of high
resistance. In order that incandescent lighting may be practically
possible, it is essential that the lamps shall have a certain
<i>average life</i>, that is, duration; and this useful duration is fixed
not merely by the possibility of passing a current through the
lamp at all, but by the rate at which the candle-power diminishes.
The decay of candle-power is called the <i>ageing</i> of the lamp,
and the useful life of the lamp may be said to be that period
of its existence before it has deteriorated to a point when it gives
only 75% of its original candle-power. It is found that in
practice carbon filament lamps, as at present made, if worked
at a higher efficiency than 2½ watts per candle-power, exhibit
a rapid deterioration in candle-power and an abbreviated life.
Hence lamp manufacturers classify lamps into various classes,
marked for use say at 2½, 3, 3½ and 4 watts per candle. A 2½
watt per candle lamp would be called a <i>high-efficiency lamp</i>,
and a 4 watt per candle lamp would be called a <i>low-efficiency</i>
lamp. In ordinary circumstances the low-efficiency lamp
would probably have a longer life, but its light would be less
suitable for many purposes of illumination in which colour
discrimination is required.</p>

<p>The possibility of employing high-efficiency lamps depends
greatly on the uniformity of the electric pressure of the supply.
If the voltage is exceedingly uniform, then high-efficiency lamps
can be satisfactorily employed; but they are not adapted
for standing the variations in pressure which are liable to occur
with public supply-stations, since, other things being equal,
their filaments are less substantial. The classification into
high and low voltage lamps is based upon the watts per candle-power
corresponding to the marked volts. When incandescent
lamps were first introduced, the ordinary working voltage was
50 or 100, but now a large number of public supply-stations
furnish current to consumers at a pressure of 200 or 250 volts.
This increase was necessitated by the enlarging area of supply
in towns, and therefore the necessity for conveying through
the same subterranean copper cables a large supply of electric
energy without increasing the maximum current value and
the size of the cables. This can only be done by employing
a higher working electromotive force; hence arose a demand
for incandescent lamps having marked volts of 200 and upwards,
technically termed high-voltage lamps. The employment of
higher pressures in public supply-stations has necessitated
greater care in the selection of the lamp fittings, and in the
manner of carrying out the wiring work. The advantages,
however, of higher supply pressures, from the point of view
of supply-stations, are undoubted. At the same time the
consumer desired a lamp of a higher efficiency than the ordinary
carbon filament lamp. The demand for this stimulated efforts
to produce improved carbon lamps, and it was found that if
the filament were exposed to a very high temperature, 3000° C.
in an electric furnace, it became more refractory and was capable
of burning in a lamp at an efficiency of 2½ watts per c.p. Inventors
also turned their attention to substances other than
carbon which can be rendered incandescent by the electric
current.</p>

<p>The luminous efficiency of any source of light, that is to say,
the percentage of rays emitted which affect the eye as light
compared with the total radiation, is dependent upon
its temperature. In an ordinary oil lamp the luminous
<span class="sidenote">Oxide filaments.</span>
rays do not form much more than 3% of the total
radiation. In the carbon-filament incandescent lamp, when
worked at about 3 watts per candle, the luminous efficiency is
about 5%; and in the arc lamp the radiation from the crater
contains about 10 to 15% of eye-affecting radiation. The
temperature of a carbon filament working at about 3 watts per
candle is not far from the melting-point of platinum, that is to
say, is nearly 1775° C. If it is worked at a higher efficiency,
say 2.5 watts per candle-power, the temperature rises rapidly,
and at the same time the volatilization and molecular scattering
of the carbon is rapidly increased, so that the average duration
of the lamp is very much shortened. An improvement, therefore,
in the efficiency of the incandescent lamp can only be obtained
by finding some substance which will endure heating to a higher
temperature than the carbon filament. Inventors turned their
attention many years ago, with this aim, to the refractory
oxides and similar substances. Paul Jablochkoff in 1877 described
and made a lamp consisting of a piece of kaolin, which was
brought to a state of incandescence first by passing over it an
electric spark, and afterwards maintained in a state of incandescence
by a current of lower electromotive force. Lane Fox
and Edison, in 1878, proposed to employ platinum wires covered
with films of lime, magnesia, steatite, or with the rarer oxides,
zirconia, thoria, &amp;c.; and Lane Fox, in 1879, suggested as an
incandescent substance a mixture of particles of carbon with
the earthy oxides. These earthy oxides&mdash;magnesia, lime and
the oxides of the rare earths, such as thoria, zirconia, erbia,
yttria, &amp;c.&mdash;possess the peculiarity that at ordinary temperatures
they are practically non-conductors, but at very high temperatures
their resistance at a certain point rapidly falls, and they
become fairly good conductors. Hence if they can once be brought
into a state of incandescence a current can pass through them
and maintain them in that state. But at this temperature
they give up oxygen to carbon; hence no mixtures of earthy
oxides with carbon are permanent when heated, and failure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page669" id="page669"></a>669</span>
has attended all attempts to use a carbon filament covered
with such substances as thoria, zirconia or other of the rare
oxides.</p>

<p>H. W. Nernst in 1897, however, patented an incandescent
lamp in which the incandescent body consists entirely of a
slender rod or filament of magnesia. If such a rod
is heated by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe to a high
<span class="sidenote">Nernst lamp.</span>
temperature it becomes conductive, and can then be
maintained in an intensely luminous condition by passing a
current through it after the flame is withdrawn. Nernst found
that by mixing together, in suitable proportions, oxides of the
rare earths, he was able to prepare a material which can be
formed into slender rods and threads, and which is rendered
sufficiently conductive to pass a current with an electromotive
force as low as 100 volts, merely by being heated for a few
moments with a spirit lamp, or even by the radiation from a
neighbouring platinum spiral brought to a state of incandescence.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Nernst lamp, therefore (fig. 17), consists of a slender rod of
the mixed oxides attached to platinum wires by an oxide paste.
Oxide filaments of this description are
not enclosed in an exhausted glass vessel,
and they can be brought, without risk
of destruction, to a temperature considerably
higher than a carbon filament; hence
the lamp has a higher luminous efficiency.
The material now used for the oxide rod
or &ldquo;glower&rdquo; of Nernst lamps is a mixture
of zirconia and yttria, made into a paste
and squirted or pressed into slender rods.
This material is non-conductive when cold,
but when slightly heated it becomes conductive
and then falls considerably in
resistance. The glower, which is straight
in some types of the lamp but curved in
others, is generally about 3 or 4 cm. long
and 1 or 2 mm. in diameter. It is held
in suitable terminals, and close to it, or
round it, but not touching it, is a loose
coil of platinum wire, also covered with
oxide and called the &ldquo;heater&rdquo; (fig. 18).
In series with it is a spiral of iron wire,
enclosed in a bulb full of hydrogen,
which is called the &ldquo;ballast resistance.&rdquo;
The socket also contains a switch controlled
by an electromagnet. When the
current is first switched on it passes through the heater coil which,
becoming incandescent, by radiation heats the glower until it
becomes conductive. The glower then takes current, becoming
itself brilliantly incandescent, and the electromagnet becoming
energized switches the heater coil out of circuit. The iron ballast
wire increases in resistance with increase of current, and so operates
to keep the total current through the glower constant in spite of
small variations of circuit voltage. The disadvantages of the lamp
are (1) that it does not light immediately after the current is switched
on and is therefore not convenient for domestic use; (2) that it
cannot be made in small light units such as 5 c.p.; (3) that the
socket and fixture
are large and more
complicated than
for the carbon filament
lamp. But
owing to the higher
temperature, the
light is whiter than
that of the carbon
glow lamp, and the
efficiency or candle
power per watt is
greater. Since,
however, the lamp
must be included
in an opal globe,
some considerable
part of this last
advantage is lost. On the whole the lamp has found its field of
operation rather in external than in domestic lighting.</p>
</div>

<p>Great efforts were made in the latter part of the 19th century
and the first decade of the 20th to find a material for the filament
of an incandescent lamp which could replace carbon
and yet not require a preliminary heating like the
<span class="sidenote">Metallic filament lamps.</span>
oxide glowers. This resulted in the production of
refractory metallic filament lamps made of osmium,
tantalum, tungsten and other rare metals. Auer von Welsbach
suggested the use of osmium. This metal cannot be drawn
into wire on account of its brittleness, but it can be made into
a filament by mixing the finely divided metal with an organic
binding material which is carbonized in the usual way at a high
temperature, the osmium particles then cohering. The
difficulty has hitherto been to construct in this way metallic
filament lamps of low candle power (16 c.p.) for 220 volt
circuits, but this is being overcome. When used on modern
supply circuits of 220 volts a number of lamps may be run
in series, or a step-down transformer employed.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Tantalum
Lamp.</td></tr></table>

<p>The next great improvement came when W. von Bolton
produced the tantalum lamp in 1904. There are certain metals
known to have a melting point about 2000° C. or upwards, and
of these tantalum is one. It can be produced from the potassium
tantalo-fluoride in a pulverulent form. By carefully melting
it <i>in vacuo</i> it can then be converted into the reguline form and
drawn into wire. In this condition it has a density of 16.6
(water = 1), is harder than platinum and has greater tensile
strength than steel, viz. 95 kilograms per sq. mm., the value
for good steel being 70 to 80 kilograms per sq. mm. The
electrical resistance at 15° C. is 0.146 ohms per metre with section
of 1 sq. mm. after annealing at 1900° C. <i>in vacuo</i> and
therefore about 6 times that of mercury; the temperature
coefficient is 0.3 per degree C. At the temperature assumed
in an incandescent lamp when working at 1.5 watts per c.p.
the resistance is 0.830 ohms per metre with a section of 1 sq.
mm. The specific heat is 0.0365. Bolton invented methods of
producing tantalum in the form of a long fine wire 0.05 mm.
in diameter. To make a 25 c.p. lamp 650 mm., or about 2 ft.,
of this wire are wound backwards and forwards zigzag on
metallic supports carried on a glass
frame, which is sealed into an exhausted
glass bulb. The tantalum
lamp so made (fig. 19), working
on a 110 volt circuit takes 0.36
amperes or 39 watts, and hence has an
efficiency of about 1.6 watts per c.p.
The useful life, that is the time in which
it loses 20% of its initial candle power,
is about 400-500 hours, but in general
a life of 800-1000 hours can be obtained.
The bulb blackens little in use, but the
life is said to be shorter with alternating
than with direct current. When
worked on alternating current circuits
the filament after a time breaks up into
sections which become curiously sheared
with respect to each other but still
maintain electrical contact. The resistance
of tantalum increases with the
temperature; hence the temperature
coefficient is positive, and sudden rises in working voltage do not
cause such variations in candle-power as in the case of the carbon
lamp.</p>

<p>Patents have also been taken out for lamps made with filaments
of such infusible metals as tungsten and molybdenum, and
Siemens and Halske, Sanders and others, have protected methods
for employing zirconium and other rare metals. According to
the patents of Sanders (German patents Nos. 133701, 137568,
137569) zirconium filaments are manufactured from the hydrogen
or nitrogen compounds of the rare earths by the aid of some
organic binding material. H. Kuzel of Vienna (British Patent
No. 28154 of 1904) described methods of making metallic
filaments from any metal. He employs the metals in a colloidal
condition, either as hydrosol, organosol, gel, or colloidal suspension.
The metals are thus obtained in a gelatinous form, and
can be squirted into filaments which are dried and reduced to
the metallic form by passing an electric current through them
(<i>Electrician</i>, 57, 894). This process has a wide field of application,
and enables the most refractory and infusible metals to
be obtained in a metallic wire form. The zirconium and tungsten
wire lamps are equal to or surpass the tantalum lamp in efficiency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page670" id="page670"></a>670</span>
and are capable of giving light, with a useful commercial life,
at an efficiency of about one watt per candle. Lamps called
osram lamps, with filaments composed of an alloy of osmium
and tungsten (wolfram), can be used with a life of 1000 hours
when run at an efficiency of about 1.5 watts per candle.</p>

<p>Tungsten lamps are made by the processes of Just and Hanaman
(German patent No. 154262 of 1903) and of Kuzel, and
at a useful life of 1000 hours, with a falling off in light-giving
power of only 10-15%, they have been found to work at an
efficiency of one to 1.25 watts per c.p. Further collected information
on modern metallic wire lamps and the patent literature
thereof will be found in an article in the <i>Engineer</i> for December
7, 1906.</p>

<p>Mention should also be made of the Helion filament glow
lamp in which the glower is composed largely of silicon, a carbon
filament being used as a base. This filament is said to have a
number of interesting qualities and an efficiency of about 1 watt
per candle (see the <i>Electrician</i>, 1907, 58, p. 567).</p>

<p>The mercury vapour lamps of P. Cooper-Hewitt, C. O. Bastian
and others have a certain field of usefulness. If a glass tube,
highly exhausted, contains mercury vapour and a
mercury cathode and iron anode, a current can be
<span class="sidenote">Mercury vapour lamps.</span>
passed through it under high electromotive force and
will then be maintained when the voltage is reduced.
The mercury vapour is rendered incandescent and glows with a
brilliant greenish light which is highly actinic, but practically
monochromatic, and is therefore not suitable for general illumination
because it does not reveal objects in their daylight colours.
It is, however, an exceedingly economical source of light. A
3-ampere Cooper-Hewitt mercury lamp has an efficiency of
0.15 to 0.33 watts per candle, or practically the same as an arc
lamp, and will burn for several thousand hours. A similar
lamp with mercury vapour included in a tube of <i>uviol</i> glass
specially transparent to ultra-violet light (prepared by Schott &amp;
Co. of Jena) seems likely to replace the Finsen arc lamp in the
treatment of lupus. Many attempts have been made to render
the mercury vapour lamp polychromatic by the use of amalgams
of zinc, sodium and bismuth in place of pure mercury for the
negative electrode.</p>

<p>An important matter in connexion with glow lamps is their
photometry. The arrangement most suitable for the photometry
and testing of incandescent lamps is a gallery
or room large enough to be occupied by several workers,
<span class="sidenote">Photometry of glow lamps.</span>
the walls being painted dead black. The photometer,
preferably one of the Lummer-Brodhun form, is set
up on a gallery or bench. On one side of it must be fixed a
working standard, which as first suggested by Fleming is preferably
a large bulb incandescent lamp with a specially &ldquo;aged&rdquo;
filament. Its candle-power can be compared, at regular intervals
and known voltages, with that of some accepted flame standard,
such as the 10 candle pentane lamp of Vernon Harcourt. In
a lamp factory or electrical laboratory it is convenient to have
a number of such large bulb standard lamps. This working
standard should be maintained at a fixed distance on one side
of the photometer, such that when worked at a standard voltage
it creates an illumination of one candle-foot on one side of the
photometer disk. The incandescent lamp to be examined is
then placed on the other side of the photometer disk on a travelling
carriage, so that it can be moved to and fro. Arrangements
must be made to measure the current and the voltage of this
lamp under test, and this is most accurately accomplished by
employing a potentiometer (<i>q.v.</i>). The holder which carries
the lamp should allow the lamp to be held with its axis in any
required position; in making normal measurements the lamp
should have its axis vertical, the filament being so situated that
none of the turns or loops overlies another as seen from the
photometer disk. Observations can then be made of the candle-power
corresponding to different currents and voltages.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The candle-power of the lamp varies with the other variables in
accordance with exponential laws of the following kind:&mdash;</p>

<p>If A is the current in amperes through the lamp, V the voltage
or terminal potential difference, W the power absorbed in watts, <i>c.p.</i>
the maximum candle-power, and <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c., constants, it has been
found that A and <i>c.p.</i> are connected by an exponential law such that</p>

<p class="center"><i>c.p.</i> = <i>a</i>A<span class="sp">x</span></p>

<p class="noind">For carbon filament lamps <i>x</i> is a number lying between 5 and 6,
generally equal to 5.5 or 5.6. Also it has been found that <i>c.p.</i> = <i>b</i>W³
very nearly, and that</p>

<p class="center"><i>c.p.</i> = <i>c</i>V<span class="sp">y</span> nearly</p>

<p class="noind">where <i>c</i> is some other constant, and for carbon filaments <i>y</i> is a
number nearly equal to 6. It is obvious that if the candle-power
of the lamp varies very nearly as the 6th power of the current and
of the voltage, the candle-power must vary as the cube of the
wattage.</p>

<p>Sir W. de W. Abney and E. R. Festing have also given a formula
connecting candle-power and watts equivalent to <i>c.p.</i> = (W &minus; <i>d</i>)²
where <i>d</i> is a constant.</p>

<p>In the case of the tantalum lamp the exponent <i>x</i> has a value near
to 6, but the exponent <i>y</i> is a number near to 4, and the same for the
osmium filament. Hence for these metallic glowers a certain percentage
variation of voltage does not create so great a variation in
candle-power as in the case of the carbon lamp.</p>

<p>Curves delineating the relation of these variables for any incandescent
lamp are called its <i>characteristic-curves</i>. The life or average
duration is a function of W/<i>c.p.</i>, or of the <i>watts per candle-power</i>,
and therefore of the voltage at which the lamp is worked. It
follows from the above relation that the watts per candle-power
vary inversely as the fourth power of the voltage.</p>

<p>From limited observations it seems that the average life of a
carbon-filament lamp varies as the fifth or sixth power of the watts
per candle-power. If V is the voltage at which the lamp is worked
and L is its average life, then L varies roughly as the twenty-fifth
power of the reciprocal of the voltage, or</p>

<p class="center">L = <i>a</i>V<span class="sp">&minus;25</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">A closer approximation to experience is given by the formula</p>

</div>

<p>All forms of incandescent or glow lamps are found to deteriorate
in light-giving power with use. In the case of carbon filaments
this is due to two causes. As already explained,
carbon is scattered from the filament and deposited
<span class="sidenote">Ageing of lamps.</span>
upon the glass, and changes also take place in the
filament which cause it to become reduced in temperature, even
when subjected to the same terminal voltage. In many lamps
it is found that the first effect of running the lamp is slightly to
increase its candle-power, even although the voltage be kept
constant; this is the result of a small decrease in the resistance
of the filament. The heating to which it is subjected slightly
increases the density of the carbon at the outset; this has
the effect of making the filament lower in resistance, and therefore
it takes more current at a constant voltage. The greater part,
however, of the subsequent decay in candle-power is due to the
deposit of carbon upon the bulb, as shown by the fact that if
the filament is taken out of the bulb and put into a new clean
bulb the candle-power in the majority of cases returns to its
original value. For every lamp there is a certain point in its
career which may be called the &ldquo;smashing-point,&rdquo; when the
candle-power falls below a certain percentage of the original
value, and when it is advantageous to replace it by a new one.
Variations of pressure in the electric supply exercise a prejudicial
effect upon the light-giving qualities of incandescent lamps.
If glow lamps, nominally of 100 volts, are supplied from a public
lighting-station, in the mains of which the pressure varies
between 90 and 110 volts, their life will be greatly abbreviated,
and they will become blackened much sooner than would be the
case if the pressure were perfectly constant. Since the candle-power
of the lamp varies very nearly as the fifth or sixth power
of the voltage, it follows that a variation of 10% in the electromotive
force creates a variation of nearly 50% in the candle-power.
Thus a 16 candle-power glow lamp, marked for use at
100 volts, was found on test to give the following candle-powers
at voltages varying between 90 and 105: At 105 volts it gave
22.8 c.p.; at 100 volts, 16.7 c.p.; at 95 volts, 12.2 c.p.; and at
90 volts, 8.7 c.p. Thus a variation of 25% in the candle-power
was caused by a variation in voltage of only 5%. The same
kind of variation in working voltage exercises also a marked
effect upon the average duration of the lamp. The following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page671" id="page671"></a>671</span>
figures show the results of some tests on typical 3.1 watt lamps
run at voltages above the normal, taking the average life when
worked at the marked volts (namely, 100) as 1000 hours:</p>

<p>Self-acting regulators have been devised by which the voltage
at the points of consumption is kept constant, even although
it varies at the point of generation. If, however,
<span class="sidenote">Voltage regulators.</span>
such a device is to be effective, it must operate very
quickly, as even the momentary effect of increased
pressure is felt by the lamp. It is only therefore where
the working pressure can be kept exceedingly constant that
high-efficiency lamps can be advantageously employed, otherwise
the cost of lamp renewals more than counterbalances the economy
in the cost of power. The slow changes that occur in the resistance
of the filament make themselves evident by an increase
in the watts per candle-power. The following table shows some
typical figures indicating the results of ageing in a 16 candle-power

<p>The gradual increase in watts per candle-power shown by this
table does not imply necessarily an increase in the total power
taken by the lamp, but is the consequence of the decay in candle-power
produced by the blackening of the lamp. Therefore,
to estimate the value of an incandescent lamp the user must
take into account not merely the price of the lamp and the initial
watts per candle-power, but the rate of decay of the lamp.</p>

<p>The scattering of carbon from the filament to the glass bulb
produces interesting physical effects, which have been studied
by T. A. Edison, W. H. Preece and J. A. Fleming.
If into an ordinary carbon-filament glow lamp a
<span class="sidenote">Edison effect.</span>
platinum plate is sealed, not connected to the filament
but attached to a third terminal, then it is found that when
the lamp is worked with continuous current a galvanometer
connected in between the middle plate and the positive terminal
of the lamp indicates a current, but not when connected in
between the negative terminal of the lamp and the middle plate.
If the middle plate is placed between the legs of a horse-shoe-shaped
filament, it becomes blackened most quickly on the
side facing the negative leg. This effect, commonly called the
<i>Edison effect</i>, is connected with an electric discharge and convection
of carbon which takes place between the two extreme
ends of the filament, and, as experiment seems to show, consists
in the conveyance of an electric charge, either by carbon molecules
or by bodies smaller than molecules. There is, however, an
electric discharge between the ends of the filament, which
rapidly increases with the temperature of the filament and
the terminal voltage; hence one of the difficulties of manufacturing
high-voltage glow lamps, that is to say, glow lamps
for use on circuits having an electromotive force of 200 volts
and upwards, is the discharge from one leg of the filament
to the other.</p>

<p>A brief allusion may be made to the mode of use of incandescent
lamps for interior and private lighting. At the present time
hardly any other method of distribution is adopted
than that of an arrangement <i>in parallel</i>; that is
<span class="sidenote">Domestic use.</span>
to say, each lamp on the circuit has one terminal
connected to a wire which finally terminates at one pole of the
generator, and its other terminal connected to a wire leading
to the other pole. The lamp filaments are thus arranged between
the conductors like the rungs of a ladder. In series with each
lamp is placed a switch and a fuse or cut-out. The lamps themselves
are attached to some variety of ornamental fitting, or
in many cases suspended by a simple pendant, consisting of
an insulated double flexible wire attached at its upper end
to a ceiling rose, and carrying at the lower end a shade and
socket in which the lamp is placed. Lamps thus hung head
downwards are disadvantageously used because their <i>end-on
candle-power</i> is not generally more than 60% of their maximum
candle-power. In interior lighting one of the great objects
to be attained is uniformity of illumination with avoidance
of harsh shadows. This can only be achieved by a proper
distribution of the lamps. It is impossible to give any hard
and fast rules as to what number must be employed in the
illumination of any room, as a great deal depends upon the
nature of the reflecting surfaces, such as the walls, ceilings,
&amp;c. As a rough guide, it may be stated that for every 100 sq.
ft. of floor surface one 16 candle-power lamp placed about
8 ft. above the floor will give a dull illumination, two will give
a good illumination and four will give a brilliant illumination.
We generally judge of the nature of the illumination in a room
by our ability to read comfortably in any position. That this
may be done, the horizontal illumination on the book should
not be less than one candle-foot. The following table shows
approximately the illuminations in candle-feet, in various
situations, derived from actual experiments:&mdash;</p>

<p>From an artistic point of view, one of the worst methods
of lighting a room is by pendant lamps, collected in single
centres in large numbers. The lights ought to be distributed
in different portions of the room, and so shaded that the light
is received only by reflection from surrounding objects. Ornamental
effects are frequently produced by means of candle
lamps in which a small incandescent lamp, imitating the flame
of a candle, is placed upon a white porcelain tube as a holder,
and these small units are distributed and arranged in electroliers
and brackets. For details as to the various modes of placing
conducting wires in houses, and the various precautions for
safe usage, the reader is referred to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electricity
Supply</a></span>. In the case of low voltage metallic filament lamps
when the supply is by alternating current there is no difficulty
in reducing the service voltage to any lower value by means
of a transformer. In the case of direct current the only method
available for working such low voltage lamps off higher supply
voltages is to arrange the lamps in series.</p>

<p><i>Commercial Aspects</i>.&mdash;The cost of supplying electricity depends
more upon the rate of supply than upon the quantity supplied;
or, as John Hopkinson put it, &ldquo;the cost of supplying
electricity for 1000 lamps for ten hours is very much
<span class="sidenote">Methods of charging.</span>
less than ten times the cost of supplying the same
number of lamps for one hour.&rdquo; Efforts have therefore
been made to devise a system of charge which shall in each case
bear some relation to the cost of the service. Consumers vary
largely both in respect to the quantity and to the period of their
demands, but the cost of supplying any one of them with a given
amount of electricity is chiefly governed by the amount of his
maximum demand at any one time. The reason for this is that
it is not generally found expedient to store electricity in large
quantities. Electricity supply works generate the electricity
for the most part at the moment it is used by the consumer.
Electric lamps are normally in use on an average for only about
four hours per day, and therefore the plant and organization,
if employed for a lighting load only, are idle and unremunerative
for about 20 hours out of the 24. It is necessary to have in
readiness machinery capable of supplying the maximum possible
requirements of all the consumers at any hour, and this accounts
for a very large proportion of the total cost. The cost of raw
material, viz. coal, water and stores consumed in the generation
of electricity sold, forms relatively only a small part of the total
cost, the major part of which is made up of the fixed charges
attributable to the time during which the works are unproductive.
This makes it very desirable to secure demands possessing high
&ldquo;load&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; factors. The correct way to charge
for electricity is to give liberal rebates to those consumers who
make prolonged and regular use of the plant, that is to say,
the lower the &ldquo;peak&rdquo; demand and the more continuous the
consumption, the better should be the discount. The consumer
must be discouraged from making sudden large demands on the
plant, and must be encouraged, while not reducing his total
consumption, to spread his use of the plant over a large number
of hours during the year. Mr Arthur Wright has devised a
tariff which gives effect to this principle. The system necessitates
the use of a special indicator&mdash;not to measure the quantity of
electricity consumed, which is done by the ordinary meter&mdash;but
to show the maximum amount of current taken by the
consumer at any one time during the period for which he is to
be charged. In effect it shows the proportion of plant which
has had to be kept on hand for his use. If the indicator shows
that say twenty lamps is the greatest number which the consumer
has turned on simultaneously, then he gets a large discount on
all the current which his ordinary meter shows that he has
taken beyond the equivalent of one hour&rsquo;s daily use of those
twenty lamps. Generally the rate charged under this system
is 7d. per unit for the equivalent of one hour&rsquo;s daily use of the
maximum demand and 1d. per unit for all surplus. It is on this
principle that it pays to supply current for tramway and other
purposes at a price which primâ facie is below the cost of production;
it is only apparently so in comparison with the cost of
producing electricity for lighting purposes. In the case of
tramways the electricity is required for 15 or 16 hours per day.
Electricity for a single lamp would cost on the basis of this
&ldquo;maximum-demand-indicator&rdquo; system for 15 hours per day
only 1.86d. per unit. In some cases a system of further discounts
to very large consumers is combined with the Wright system.
Some undertakers have abandoned the Wright system in favour
of average flat rates, but this does not imply any failure of the
Wright system; on the contrary, the system, having served to
establish the most economical consumption of electricity, has
demonstrated the average rate at which the undertakers are
able to give the supply at a fair profit, and the proportion of
possible new customers being small the undertakers find it a
simplification to dispense with the maximum demand indicator.
But in some cases a mistake has been made by offering the
unprofitable early-closing consumers the option of obtaining
electricity at a flat rate much lower than their load-factor would
warrant and below cost price. The effect of this is to nullify
the Wright system of charging, for a consumer will not elect to
pay for his electricity on the Wright system if he can obtain a
lower rate by means of a flat rate system. Thus the long-hour
profitable consumer is made to pay a much higher price than
he need be charged, in order that the unprofitable short-hour
consumer may be retained and be made actually still more
unprofitable. It is not improbable that ultimately the supply
will be charged for on the basis of a rate determined by the size
and character of the consumer&rsquo;s premises, or the number and
dimensions of the electrical points, much in the same way as
water is charged for by a water rate determined by the rent
of the consumer&rsquo;s house and the number of water taps.</p>

<p>Most new houses within an electricity supply area are wired
for electricity during construction, but in several towns means
have to be taken to encourage small shopkeepers and
tenants of small houses to use electricity by removing
<span class="sidenote">Wiring of houses.</span>
the obstacle of the first outlay on wiring. The cost
of wiring may be taken at 15s. to £2 per lamp installed including
all necessary wire, switches, fuses, lamps, holders, casing, but
not electroliers or shades. Many undertakers carry out wiring
on the easy payment or hire-purchase system. Parliament
has sanctioned the adoption of these systems by some local
authorities and even authorized them to do the work by direct
employment of labour. The usual arrangement is to make an
additional charge of ½d. per unit on all current used, with a
minimum payment of 1s. per 8 c.p. lamp, consumers having the
option of purchasing the installation at any time on specified
conditions. The consumer has to enter into an agreement,
and if he is only a tenant the landlord has to sign a memorandum
to the effect that the wiring and fittings belong to the supply
undertakers. Several undertakers have adopted a system of
maintenance and renewal of lamps, and at least one local authority
undertakes to supply consumers with lamps free of charge.</p>

<p>There is still considerable scope for increasing the business
of electricity supply by judicious advertising and other methods.
Comparisons of the kilowatt hour consumption per
capita in various towns show that where an energetic
<span class="sidenote">Consumption.</span>
policy has been pursued the profits have improved by
reason of additional output combined with increased load factor.
The average number of equivalent 8 c.p. lamps connected per
capita in the average of English towns is about 1.2. The
average number of units consumed per capita per annum is
about 23, and the average income per capita per annum is about
5s. In a number of American cities 20s. per capita per annum is
obtained. In the United States a co-operative electrical development
association canvasses both the general public and the
electricity supply undertakers. Funds are provided by the manufacturing
companies acting in concert with the supply authorities
and contractors, and the spirit underlying the work is to advertise
the merits of electricity&mdash;not any particular company or interest.
Their efforts are directed to securing new consumers and stimulating
the increased and more varied use of electricity among
actual consumers.</p>

<p>All supply undertakers are anxious to develop the consumption
of electricity for power purposes even more than
for lighting, but the first cost of installing electric motors is
a deterrent to the adoption of electricity in small factories
and shops, and most undertakers are therefore prepared to let
out motors, &amp;c., on hire or purchase on varying terms according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>A board of trade unit will supply one 8 c.p. carbon lamp of
30 hours or 30 such lamps for one hour. In average use an
incandescent lamp will last about 800 hours, which is equal
to about 12 months normal use; a good lamp will frequently
last more than double this time before it breaks down.</p>

<p>Apart from cheaper methods of generation there are two
main sources of economy in electric lighting. One is the improved
arrangement and use of electrical installations, and the other
is the employment of lamps of higher efficiency. As regards
the first, increased attention has been given to the position,
candle-power and shading of electric lamps so as to give the
most effective illumination in varying circumstances and to
avoid excess of light. The ease with which electric lamps may
be switched on and off from a distance has lent itself to arrangements
whereby current may be saved by switching off lights
not in use and by controlling the number of lamps required to
be alight at one time on an electrolier. Appreciable economies
are brought about by the scientific disposition of lights and the
avoidance of waste in use. As regards the other source of
economy, the Nernst, the tantalum, the osram, and the metallized
carbon filament lamp, although costing more in the first instance
than carbon lamps, have become popular owing to their economy
in current consumption. Where adopted largely they have had
a distinct effect in reducing the rate of increase of output from
supply undertakings, but their use has been generally encouraged
as tending towards the greater popularity of electric light and
an ultimately wider demand. Mercury vapour lamps for indoor
and outdoor lighting have also proved their high efficiency, and
the use of flame arc lamps has greatly increased the cheapness
of outdoor electric lighting.</p>

<p>The existence of a &ldquo;daylight load&rdquo; tends to reduce the all-round
cost of generating and distributing electricity. This
daylight load is partly supplied by power for industrial purposes
and partly by the demand for electricity in many domestic
operations. The use of electric heating and cooking apparatus
(including radiators, ovens, grills, chafing dishes, hot plates,
kettles, flat-irons, curling irons, &amp;c.) has greatly developed,
and provides a load which extends intermittently throughout
the greater part of the twenty-four hours. Electric fans for
home ventilation are also used, and in the domestic operations
where a small amount of power is required (as in driving sewing
machines, boot cleaners, washing machines, mangles, knife
cleaners, &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; cleaners, &amp;c.) the electric motor is being
largely adopted. The trend of affairs points to a time when the
total demand from such domestic sources will greatly exceed
the demand for lighting only. The usual charges for current
to be used in domestic heating or power operations vary from
1d. to 2d. per unit. As the demand increases the charges will
undergo reduction, and there will also be a reflex action in bringing
down the cost of electricity for lighting owing to the improved
load factor resulting from an increase in the day demand. In
the cooking and heating and motor departments also there has
been improvement in the efficiency of the apparatus, and its
economy is enhanced by the fact that current may be switched
on and off as required.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade are now prepared to receive electric
measuring instruments for examination or testing at their
<span class="sidenote">Testing meters.</span>
electrical standardizing laboratory, where they have
a battery power admitting of a maximum current of
7000 amperes to be dealt with. The London county
council and some other corporations are prepared upon requisition
to appoint inspectors to test meters on consumers&rsquo; premises.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>All supply undertakers now issue rules and regulations for the
efficient wiring of electric installations. The rules and regulations
issued by the institution of electrical engineers have been
accepted by many local authorities and companies, and
<span class="sidenote">Wiring rules.</span>
also by many of the fire insurance companies. The
Phoenix fire office rules were the first to be drawn up, and are
adopted by many of the fire offices, but some other leading insurance
offices have their own rules under which risks are accepted without
extra premium. In the opinion of the insurance companies &ldquo;the
electric light is the safest of all illuminants
and is preferable to any others when the
installation has been thoroughly well put up.&rdquo;
Regulations have also been issued by the
London county council in regard to theatres,
&amp;c., by the national board of fire underwriters
of America (known as the &ldquo;National Electrical
Code&rdquo;), by the fire underwriters association
of Victoria (Commonwealth of Australia),
by the Calcutta fire insurance agents association and under the
Canadian Electric Light Inspection Act. In Germany rules have
been issued by the Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker and by the
union of private fire insurance companies of Germany, in Switzerland
by the Association Suisse des électriciens, in Austria by the Elektrotechnischer

<p><span class="bold">LIGHTNING<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span>, the visible flash that accompanies an electric
discharge in the sky. In certain electrical conditions of the
atmosphere a cloud becomes highly charged by the coalescence
of drops of vapour. A large drop formed by the fusion of many
smaller ones contains the same amount of electricity upon a
smaller superficial area, and the electric potential of each drop,
and of the whole cloud, rises. When the cloud passes near
another cloud stratum or near a hilltop, tower or tree, a discharge
takes place from the cloud in the form of lightning. The discharge
sometimes takes place from the earth to the cloud, or from a lower
to a higher stratum, and sometimes from conductors silently.
Rain discharges the electricity quietly to earth, and lightning
frequently ceases with rain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Atmospheric Electricity</a></span>).</p>

clouds which are the usual prelude to a thunder storm serve
to conduct the electricity of the upper air down towards the

space when the pressure is sufficient. Lightning discharges
were distinguished by Sir Oliver Lodge into two distinct types&mdash;the
<i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> flashes. The <i>A</i> flash is of the simple type which
arises when an electrically charged cloud approaches the earth
without an intermediate cloud intervening. In the second type
<i>B</i>, where another cloud intervenes between the cloud carrying
the primary charge and the earth, the two clouds practically
form a condenser; and when a discharge from the first takes
place into the second the free charge on the earth side of the
lower cloud is suddenly relieved, and the disruptive discharge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page674" id="page674"></a>674</span>
from the latter to earth takes such an erratic course that according
to the Lightning Research Committee &ldquo;no series of lightning
conductors of the hitherto recognized type suffice to protect
the building.&rdquo; In Germany two kinds of lightning stroke
have been recognized, one as &ldquo;zündenden&rdquo; (causing fire),
analogous to the <i>B</i> flash, the other as &ldquo;kalten&rdquo; (not causing
fire), the ordinary <i>A</i> discharge. The destructive effect of the
former was noticed in 1884 by A. Parnell, who quoted instances
of damage due to mechanical force, which he stated in many
cases took place in a more or less upward direction.</p>

<p>The object of erecting a number of pointed rods to form
a lightning conductor is to produce a glow or brush discharge
and thus neutralize or relieve the tension of the thunder-cloud.
This, if the latter is of the <i>A</i> type, can be successfully accomplished,
but sometimes the lightning flash takes place so suddenly
that it cannot be prevented, however great the number of points
provided, there being such a store of energy in the descending
cloud that they are unable to ward off the shock. A <i>B</i> flash
may ignore the points and strike some metal work in the vicinity;
to avoid damage to the structure this must also be connected
to the conductors. A single air terminal is of no more use than
an inscribed sign-board; besides multiplying the number of
points, numerous paths, as well as interconnexions between
the conductors, must be arranged to lead the discharge to
the earth. The system of pipes and gutters on a roof must
be imitated; although a single rain-water pipe would be sufficient
to deal with a summer shower, in practice pipes are used
in sufficient number to carry off the greatest storm.</p>

<p><i>Protected Area.</i>&mdash;According to Lodge &ldquo;there is no space
near a rod which can be definitely styled an area of protection,
for it is possible to receive violent sparks and shocks from
the conductor itself, not to speak of the innumerable secondary
discharges that are liable to occur in the wake of the main
flash.&rdquo; The report of the Lightning Research Committee
contains many examples of buildings struck in the so-called
&ldquo;protected area.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Material for Conductors.</i>&mdash;Franklin&rsquo;s original rods (1752)
were made of iron, and this metal is still employed throughout
the continent of Europe and in the United States. British
architects, who objected to the unsightliness of the rods, eventually
specified copper tape, which is generally run round the
sharp angles of a building in such a manner as to increase the
chances of the lightning being diverted from the conductor.
The popular idea is that to secure the greatest protection a
rod of the largest area should be erected, whereas a single large
conductor is far inferior to a number of smaller ones and copper
as a material is not so suitable for the purpose as iron. A copper
rod allows the discharge to pass too quickly and produces a
violent shock, whereas iron offers more impedance and allows
the flash to leak away by damping down the oscillations. Thus
there is less chance of a side flash from an iron than from a
copper conductor.</p>

<p><i>Causes of Failure.</i>&mdash;A number of failures of conductors
were noticed in the 1905 report of the Lightning Research
Committee. One cause was the insufficient number of conductors
and earth connexions; another was the absence of any system
for connecting the metallic portion of the buildings to the
conductors. In some cases the main stroke was received, but
damage occurred by side-flash to isolated parts of the roof.
There were several examples of large metallic surfaces being
charged with electricity, the greater part of which was safely
discharged, but enough followed unauthorized paths, such as
a speaking-tube or electric bell wires, to cause damage. In
one instance a flash struck the building at two points simultaneously;
one portion followed the conductor, but the other
went to earth jumping from a small finial to a greenhouse
30 ft. below.</p>

<p><i>Construction of Conductors.</i>&mdash;The general conclusions of
the Lightning Research Committee agree with the independent
reports of similar investigators in Germany, Hungary and
Holland. The following is a summary of the suggestions made:&mdash;</p>

<p>The conductors may be of copper, or of soft iron protected by
galvanizing or coated with lead. A number of paths to earth
must be provided; well-jointed rain-water pipes may be utilized.</p>

<p>Every chimney stack or other prominence should have an air
terminal. Conductors should run in the most direct manner
from air to earth, and be kept away from the walls by holdfasts
(fig. 1), in the manner shown by A (fig. 2); the usual method
is seen in B (fig. 2), where the tape follows the contour of the
building and causes side flash. A building
with a long roof should also be fitted with
a horizontal conductor along the ridge, and
to this aigrettes (fig. 3) should be attached; a
simpler method is to support the cable by
holdfasts armed with a spike (fig. 4). Joints
must be held together mechanically as well
as electrically, and should be protected from
the action of the air. At Westminster Abbey
the cables are spliced and inserted in a box
which is filled with lead run in when molten.</p>

<p><i>Earth Connexion.</i>&mdash;A copper plate not less
than 3 sq. ft. in area may be used as an
earth connexion if buried in permanently
damp ground. Instead of a plate there are advantages in
using the tubular earth shown in fig. 5. The cable packed
in carbon descends to the bottom of the perforated tube which
is driven into the ground, a connexion
being made to the nearest rain-water
pipe to secure the necessary moisture.
No further attention is required. Plate
earths should be tested every year. The
number of earths depends on the area of
the building, but at least two should be
provided. Insulators on the conductor
are of no advantage, and it is useless to
gild or otherwise protect the points of
the air-terminals. As heated air offers
a good path for lightning (which is the
reason why the kitchen-chimney is often
selected by the discharge), a number of
points should be fixed to high chimneys
and there should be at least two conductors
to earth. All roof metals, such
as finials, flashings, rain-water gutters,
ventilating pipes, cowls and stove pipes,
should be connected to the system of
conductors. The efficiency of the installation
depends on the interconnexion
of all metallic parts, also on the quality
of the earth connexions. In the case
of magazines used for explosives, it is
questionable whether the usual plan of
erecting rods at the sides of the buildings is efficient. The only
way to ensure safety is to enclose the magazine in iron; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page675" id="page675"></a>675</span>
next best is to arrange the conductors so that they surround it
like a bird cage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The literature, although extensive, contains so
many descriptions of ludicrous devices, that the student, after
reading Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s <i>Experiments and Observations on
Electricity made at Philadelphia</i> (1769), may turn to the <i>Report</i> of
the Lightning Rod Conference of December 1881. In the latter
work there are abstracts of many valuable papers, especially the
reports made to the French Academy, among others by Coulomb,
Laplace, Gay-Lussac, Fresnel, Regnault, &amp;c. In 1876 J. Clerk
Maxwell read a paper before the British Association in which he
brought forward the idea (based on Faraday&rsquo;s experiments) of
protecting a building from the effects of lightning by surrounding it
with a sort of cage of rods or stout wire. It was not, however, until
the Bath meeting of the British Association in 1888 that the subject
was fully discussed by the physical and engineering sections. Sir
Oliver Lodge showed the futility of single conductors, and advised
the interconnexion of all the metal work on a building to a number of
conductors buried in the earth. The action of lightning flashes was
also demonstrated by him in lectures delivered before the Society of
Arts (1888). The Clerk Maxwell system was adopted to a large extent
in Germany, and in July 1901 a sub-committee of the Berlin Electro-technical
Association was formed, which published rules. In 1900
a paper entitled &ldquo;The Protection of Public Buildings from Lightning,&rdquo;
by Killingworth Hedges, led to the formation, by the Royal
Institute of British Architects and the Surveyors&rsquo; Institution, of the
Lightning Research Committee, on which the Royal Society and the
Meteorological Society were represented. The <i>Report</i>, edited by
Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir John Gavey and Killingworth Hedges (Hon.
Sec.), was published in April 1905. An illustrated supplement,
compiled by K. Hedges and entitled <i>Modern Lightning Conductors</i>
(1905), contains particulars of the independent reports of the German
committee, the Dutch Academy of Science, and the Royal Joseph
university, Budapest. A description is also given of the author&rsquo;s
modified Clerk Maxwell system, in which the metal work of the
roofs of a building form the upper part, the rain-water pipes taking
the place of the usual lightning-rods. See also Sir Oliver Lodge,
<i>Lightning Conductors</i> (London, 1902).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGHTS, CEREMONIAL USE OF.<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> The ceremonial use of
lights in the Christian Church, with which this article is mainly
concerned, probably has a double origin: in a very
natural symbolism, and in the adaptation of certain
pagan and Jewish rites and customs of which the
symbolic meaning was Christianized. Light is everywhere
<span class="sidenote">Non-Christian religions.</span>
the symbol of joy and of life-giving power, as darkness
is of death and destruction. Fire, the most mysterious and
impressive of the elements, the giver of light and of all the good
things of life, is a thing sacred and adorable in primitive religions,
and fire-worship still has its place in two at least of the great
religions of the world. The Parsis adore fire as the visible
expression of Ahura-Mazda, the eternal principle of light and
righteousness; the Brahmans worship it as divine and omniscient.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
The Hindu festival of Dew&#257;li (Diyaw&#257;l&#299;, from <i>diya</i>,
light), when temples and houses are illuminated with countless
lamps, is held every November to celebrate Lakhshmi, the goddess
of prosperity. In the ritual of the Jewish temple fire and light
played a conspicuous part. In the Holy of Holies was a &ldquo;cloud
of light&rdquo; (<i>shekinah</i>), symbolical of the presence of Yahweh, and
before it stood the candlestick with six branches, on each of
which and on the central stem was a lamp eternally burning;
while in the forecourt was an altar on which the sacred fire was
never allowed to go out. Similarly the Jewish synagogues have
each their eternal lamp; while in the religion of Islam lighted
lamps mark things and places specially holy; thus the Ka&rsquo;ba
at Mecca is illuminated by thousands of lamps hanging from
the gold and silver rods that connect the columns of the surrounding
colonnade.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans, too, had their sacred fire and their
ceremonial lights. In Greece the <i>Lampadedromia</i> or <i>Lampadephoria</i>
(torch-race) had its origin in ceremonies connected
with the relighting of the sacred fire. Pausanias
<span class="sidenote">Greece and Rome.</span>
(i. 26, § 6) mentions the golden lamp made by Callimachus
which burned night and day in the sanctuary of Athena
Polias on the Acropolis, and (vii. 22, §§ 2 and 3) tells of a statue
of Hermes Agoraios, in the market-place of Pharae in Achaea,
before which lamps were lighted. Among the Romans lighted
candles and lamps formed part of the cult of the domestic
tutelary deities; on all festivals doors were garlanded and lamps
lighted (Juvenal, <i>Sat.</i> xii. 92; Tertullian, <i>Apol.</i> xxxv.). In
the cult of Isis lamps were lighted by day. In the ordinary
temples were candelabra, <i>e.g.</i> that in the temple of Apollo
Palatinus at Rome, originally taken by Alexander from Thebes,
which was in the form of a tree from the branches of which
lights hung like fruit. In comparing pagan with Christian
usage it is important to remember that the lamps in the pagan
temples were not symbolical, but votive offerings to the gods.
Torches and lamps were also carried in religious processions.</p>

<p>The pagan custom of burying lamps with the dead conveyed
no such symbolical meaning as was implied in the late Christian
custom of placing lights on and about the tombs of
<span class="sidenote">Funeral lamps.</span>
martyrs and saints. Its object was to provide the
dead with the means of obtaining light in the next
world, a wholly material conception; and the lamps were for
the most part unlighted. It was of Asiatic origin, traces of it
having been observed in Phoenicia and in the Punic colonies,
but not in Egypt or Greece. In Europe it was confined to the
countries under the domination of Rome.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>In Christianity, from the very first, fire and light are conceived
as symbols, if not as visible manifestations, of the divine nature
and the divine presence. Christ is &ldquo;the true Light&rdquo;
(John i. 9), and at his transfiguration &ldquo;the fashion
<span class="sidenote">Christian symbolism of light.</span>
of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was
white and glistering&rdquo; (Luke ix. 29); when the
Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles, &ldquo;there appeared unto
them cloven tongues of fire, and it sat upon each of them&rdquo;
(Acts ii. 3); at the conversion of St Paul &ldquo;there shined round
him a great light from heaven&rdquo; (Acts ix. 3); while the glorified
Christ is represented as standing &ldquo;in the midst of seven candlesticks
... his head and hairs white like wool, as white as snow;
and his eyes as a flame of fire&rdquo; (Rev. i. 14, 15). Christians are
&ldquo;children of Light&rdquo; at perpetual war with &ldquo;the powers of
darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this might very early, without the incentive of Jewish
and pagan example, have affected the symbolic ritual of the
primitive Church. There is, however, no evidence of
<span class="sidenote">The early Church.</span>
any ceremonial use of lights in Christian worship during
the first two centuries. It is recorded, indeed (Acts
xx. 7, 8), that on the occasion of St Paul&rsquo;s preaching at Alexandria
in Troas &ldquo;there were many lights in the upper chamber&rdquo;;
but this was at night, and the most that can be hazarded is that
a specially large number were lighted as a festive illumination,
as in modern Church festivals (Martigny, <i>Dict. des antiqu.
Chrét.</i>). As to a purely ceremonial use, such early evidence as
exists is all the other way. A single sentence of Tertullian
(<i>Apol.</i> xxxv.) sufficiently illuminates Christian practice during
the 2nd century. &ldquo;On days of rejoicing,&rdquo; he says,
<span class="sidenote">Tertullian and Lactantius.</span>
&ldquo;we do not shade our door-posts with laurels nor
encroach upon the day-light with lamps&rdquo; (<i>die laeto
non laureis postes obumbramus nec lucernis diem
infringimus</i>). Lactantius, writing early in the 4th century, is
even more sarcastic in his references to the heathen practice.
&ldquo;They kindle lights,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as though to one who is in
darkness. Can he be thought sane who offers the light of lamps
and candles to the Author and Giver of all light?&rdquo; (<i>Div. Inst.
vi. de vero cultu</i>, cap. 2, in Migne, <i>Patr. lat.</i> vi. 637).<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> This is
primarily an attack on votive lights, and does not necessarily
exclude their ceremonial use in other ways. There is, indeed,
evidence that they were so used before Lactantius wrote. The
34th canon of the synod of Elvira (305), which was contemporary
with him, forbade candles to be lighted in cemeteries during the
day-time, which points to an established custom as well as to
an objection to it; and in the Roman catacombs lamps have
been found of the 2nd and 3rd centuries which seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page676" id="page676"></a>676</span>
been ceremonial or symbolical.<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Again, according to the <i>Acta</i>
<span class="sidenote">2nd and 3rd centuries.</span>
of St Cyprian (d. 258), his body was borne to the grave <i>praelucentibus
cereis</i>, and Prudentius, in his hymn on the
martyrdom of St Lawrence (<i>Peristeph.</i> ii. 71, in Migne,
<i>Patr. lat.</i> lx. 300), says that in the time of St
Laurentius, <i>i.e.</i> the middle of the 3rd century, candles
stood in the churches of Rome on golden candelabra. The gift,
mentioned by Anastasius (<i>in Sylv.</i>), made by Constantine to
the Vatican basilica, of a <i>pharum</i> of gold, garnished with 500
dolphins each holding a lamp, to burn before St Peter&rsquo;s tomb,
points also to a custom well established before Christianity
became the state religion.</p>

<p>Whatever previous custom may have been&mdash;and for the earliest
ages it is difficult to determine absolutely owing to the fact
<span class="sidenote">Jerome and Vigilantius.</span>
that the Christians held their services at night&mdash;by
the close of the 4th century the ceremonial use of
lights had become firmly and universally established
in the Church. This is clear, to pass by much
other evidence, from the controversy of St Jerome with
Vigilantius.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Vigilantius, a presbyter of Barcelona, still occupied the position
of Tertullian and Lactantius in this matter. &ldquo;We see,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;a rite peculiar to the pagans introduced into the churches on
pretext of religion, and, while the sun is still shining, a mass of
wax tapers lighted.... A great honour to the blessed martyrs,
whom they think to illustrate with contemptible little candles (<i>de
vilissimis cereolis</i>)!&rdquo; Jerome, the most influential theologian of
the day, took up the cudgels against Vigilantius (he &ldquo;ought to be
called Dormitantius&rdquo;), who, in spite of his fatherly admonition,
had dared again &ldquo;to open his foul mouth and send forth a filthy
stink against the relics of the holy martyrs&rdquo; (<i>Hier. Ep.</i> cix. al. 53&mdash;<i>ad
Ripuarium Presbyt.</i>, in Migne, <i>Patr. lat.</i> p. 906). If candles are
lit before their tombs, are these the ensigns of idolatry? In his
treatise <i>contra Vigilantium</i> (<i>Patr. lat.</i> t. xxiii.) he answers the question
with much common sense. There can be no harm if ignorant and
simple people, or religious women, light candles in honour of the
martyrs. &ldquo;We are not born, but reborn, Christians,&rdquo; and that
which when done for idols was detestable is acceptable when done
for the martyrs. As in the case of the woman with the precious
box of ointment, it is not the gift that merits reward, but the faith
that inspires it. As for lights in the churches, he adds that &ldquo;in all
the churches of the East, whenever the gospel is to be read, lights
are lit, though the sun be rising (<i>jam sole rutilante</i>), not in order to
disperse the darkness, but as a visible sign of gladness (<i>ad signum
laetitiae demonstrandum</i>).&rdquo; Taken in connexion with a statement
which almost immediately precedes this&mdash;&ldquo;Cereos autem non clara
luce accendimus, sicut frustra calumniaris: sed ut noctis tenebras
hoc solatio temperemus&rdquo; (§ 7)&mdash;this seems to point to the fact that the
ritual use of lights in the church services, so far as already established,
arose from the same conservative habit as determined the
development of liturgical vestments, <i>i.e.</i> the lights which had been
necessary at the nocturnal meetings were retained, after the hours
of service had been altered, and invested with a symbolical
meaning.</p>
</div>

<p>Already they were used at most of the conspicuous functions
of the Church. Paulinus, bishop of Nola (d. 431), describes
the altar at the eucharist as &ldquo;crowned with crowded
lights,&rdquo;<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and even mentions the &ldquo;eternal lamp.&rdquo;<a name="fa6c" id="fa6c" href="#ft6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Practice in the 4th century.</span>
For their use at baptisms we have, among much other
evidence, that of Zeno of Verona for the West,<a name="fa7c" id="fa7c" href="#ft7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and
that of Gregory of Nazianzus for the East.<a name="fa8c" id="fa8c" href="#ft8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Their use at funerals
is illustrated by Eusebius&rsquo;s description of the burial of Constantine,<a name="fa9c" id="fa9c" href="#ft9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
and Jerome&rsquo;s account of that of St Paula.<a name="fa10c" id="fa10c" href="#ft10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a> At
ordinations they were used, as is shown by the 6th canon of the
council of Carthage (398), which decrees that the acolyte is to
hand to the newly ordained deacon <i>ceroferarium cum cereo</i>.
As to the blessing of candles, according to the <i>Liber pontificalis</i>
Pope Zosimus in 417 ordered these to be blessed,<a name="fa11c" id="fa11c" href="#ft11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and the
Gallican and Mozarabic rituals also provided for this ceremony.<a name="fa12c" id="fa12c" href="#ft12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
The Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, known as Candlemas
(<i>q.v.</i>), because on this day the candles for the whole year are
blessed, was established&mdash;according to some authorities&mdash;by
Pope Gelasius I. about 492. As to the question of &ldquo;altar lights,&rdquo;
however, it must be borne in mind that these were not placed
upon the altar, or on a retable behind it, until the 12th century.
These were originally the candles carried by the deacons, according
to the <i>Ordo Romanus</i> (i. 8; ii. 5; iii. 7) seven in number,
which were set down either on the steps of the altar, or, later,
<span class="sidenote">Eastern Church.</span>
behind it. In the Eastern Church, to this day, there
are no lights on the high altar; the lighted candles
stand on a small altar beside it, and at various parts
of the service are carried by the lectors or acolytes before the
officiating priest or deacon. The &ldquo;crowd of lights&rdquo; described
by Paulinus as crowning the altar were either grouped round it
or suspended in front of it; they are represented by the sanctuary
lamps of the Latin Church and by the crown of lights suspended
in front of the altar in the Greek.</p>

<p>To trace the gradual elaboration of the symbolism and use
of ceremonial lights in the Church, until its full development
and systematization in the middle ages, would be
impossible here. It must suffice to note a few stages in
<span class="sidenote">Development of the use.</span>
the process. The burning of lights before the tombs
of martyrs led naturally to their being burned also
before relics and lastly before images and pictures. This latter
practice, hotly denounced as idolatry during the iconoclastic
controversy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iconoclasm</a></span>), was finally established as orthodox
by the second general council of Nicaea (787), which restored
the worship of images. A later development, however, by which
certain lights themselves came to be regarded as objects of
worship and to have other lights burned before <i>them</i>, was condemned
as idolatrous by the synod of Noyon in 1344.<a name="fa13c" id="fa13c" href="#ft13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The
passion for symbolism extracted ever new meanings out of the
candles and their use. Early in the 6th century Ennodius,
bishop of Pavia, pointed out the three-fold elements of a wax-candle
(<i>Opusc.</i> ix. and x.), each of which would make it an offering
acceptable to God; the rush-wick is the product of pure water,
the wax is the offspring of virgin bees,<a name="fa14c" id="fa14c" href="#ft14c"><span class="sp">14</span></a> the flame is sent from
heaven.<a name="fa15c" id="fa15c" href="#ft15c"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Clearly, wax was a symbol of the Blessed Virgin and
the holy humanity of Christ. The later middle ages developed
the idea. Durandus, in his <i>Rationale</i>, interprets the wax as the
body of Christ, the wick as his soul, the flame as his divine
nature; and the consuming candle as symbolizing his passion
and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page677" id="page677"></a>677</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the completed ritual system of the medieval Church, as still
preserved in the Roman Catholic communion, the use of ceremonial
<span class="sidenote">In the Roman Catholic Church.</span>
lights falls under three heads. (1) They may be symbolical
of the light of God&rsquo;s presence, of Christ as &ldquo;Light
of Light,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;the children of Light&rdquo; in conflict with
the powers of darkness; they may even be no more
than expressions of joy on the occasion of great festivals.
(2) They may be votive, <i>i.e.</i> offered as an act of worship (<i>latria</i>) to
God. (3) They are, in virtue of their benediction by the Church,
<i>sacramentalia</i>, <i>i.e.</i> efficacious for the good of men&rsquo;s souls and bodies,
and for the confusion of the powers of darkness.<a name="fa16c" id="fa16c" href="#ft16c"><span class="sp">16</span></a> With one or
<span class="sidenote">Dedication of a church.<br /><br />
At Mass and choir services.</span>
more of these implications, they are employed in all the public
functions of the Church. At the consecration of a church twelve
lights are placed round the walls at the twelve spots
where these are anointed by the bishop with holy oil,
and on every anniversary these are relighted; at the
dedication of an altar tapers are lighted and censed at
each place where the table is anointed (<i>Pontificale Rom.</i> p. ii.
<i>De eccl. dedicat. seu consecrat.</i>). At every liturgical service, and
especially at Mass and at choir services, there must be at least
two lighted tapers on the altar,<a name="fa17c" id="fa17c" href="#ft17c"><span class="sp">17</span></a> as symbols of the presence
of God and tributes of adoration. For the Mass the
rule is that there are six lights at High Mass, four at a
<i>missa cantata</i>, and two at private masses. At a Pontifical
High Mass (<i>i.e.</i> when the bishop celebrates) the lights are seven,
because seven golden candlesticks surround the risen Saviour, the
chief bishop of the Church (see Rev. i. 12). At most pontifical
functions, moreover, the bishop&mdash;as the representative of Christ&mdash;is
preceded by an acolyte with a burning candle (<i>bugia</i>) on a candlestick.
The <i>Ceremoniale Episcoporum</i> (i. 12) further orders that a
burning lamp is to hang at all times before each altar, three in front
<span class="sidenote">Sanctuary lamps.<br /><br />
Symbol of the Real Presence.</span>
of the high altar, and five before the reserved Sacrament,
as symbols of the eternal Presence. In practice, however,
it is usual to have only one lamp lighted before
the tabernacle in which the Host is reserved. The special symbol
of the real presence of Christ is the <i>Sanctus</i> candle, which is lighted
at the moment of consecration and kept burning until
the communion. The same symbolism is intended by
the lighted tapers which must accompany the Host
whenever it is carried in procession, or to the sick and
dying.</p>

<p>As symbols of light and joy a candle is held on each side of the
deacon when reading the Gospel at Mass; and the same symbolism
underlies the multiplication of lights on festivals, their number
varying with the importance of the occasion. As to the number of
these latter no rule is laid down. They differ from liturgical lights
in that, whereas these must be tapers of pure beeswax or lamps
fed with pure olive oil (except by special dispensation under certain
circumstances), those used merely to add splendour to the celebration
may be of any material; the only exception being, that in
the decoration of the altar gas-lights are forbidden.</p>

<p>In general the ceremonial use of lights in the Roman Catholic
Church is conceived as a dramatic representation in fire of the life
of Christ and of the whole scheme of salvation. On
Easter Eve the new fire, symbol of the light of the newly
<span class="sidenote">Tenebrae.</span>
risen Christ, is produced, and from this are kindled all the lights used
throughout the Christian year until, in the gathering darkness (<i>tenebrae</i>)
of the Passion, they are gradually extinguished. This quenching
of the light of the world is symbolized at the service of <i>Tenebrae</i>
in Holy Week by the placing on a stand before the altar of thirteen
lighted tapers arranged pyramidally, the rest of the church being
in darkness. The penitential psalms are sung, and at the end of
each a candle is extinguished. When only the central one is left
it is taken down and carried behind the altar, thus symbolizing the
betrayal and the death and burial of Christ. This ceremony can be
traced to the 8th century at Rome.</p>

<p>On Easter Eve new fire is made<a name="fa18c" id="fa18c" href="#ft18c"><span class="sp">18</span></a> with a flint and steel, and
blessed; from this three candles are lighted, the <i>lumen Christi</i>,
<span class="sidenote">The Paschal Candle.</span>
and from these again the Paschal Candle.<a name="fa19c" id="fa19c" href="#ft19c"><span class="sp">19</span></a> This is the
symbol of the risen and victorious Christ, and burns at
every solemn service until Ascension Day, when it is
extinguished and removed after the reading of the Gospel
at High Mass. This, of course, symbolizes the Ascension; but
meanwhile the other lamps in the church have received their light
from the Paschal Candle, and so symbolize throughout the year
the continued presence of the light of Christ.</p>

<p>At the consecration of the baptismal water the burning Paschal
Candle is dipped into the font &ldquo;so that the power of the Holy
Ghost may descend into it and make it an effective
<span class="sidenote">Baptism.<br />
Ordination, etc.<br />
Funeral lights.
</span>
instrument of regeneration.&rdquo; This is the symbol of
baptism as rebirth as children of Light. Lighted tapers are also
placed in the hands of the newly-baptized, or of their god-parents,
with the admonition &ldquo;to preserve their baptism inviolate, so that
they may go to meet the Lord when he comes to the wedding.&rdquo;
Thus, too, as &ldquo;children of Light,&rdquo; candidates for ordination
and novices about to take the vows carry lights
when they come before the bishop; and the same idea
underlies the custom of carrying lights at weddings, at the first
communion, and by priests going to their first mass, though none
of these are liturgically prescribed. Finally, lights are placed round
the bodies of the dead and carried beside them to the
grave, partly as symbols that they still live in the light
of Christ, partly to frighten away the powers of darkness.</p>

<p>Conversely, the extinction of lights is part of the ceremony of
excommunication (<i>Pontificale Rom.</i> pars iii.). Regino, abbot of Prum,
<span class="sidenote">Excommunication.</span>
describes the ceremony as it was carried out in his day,
when its terrors were yet unabated (<i>De eccles. disciplina</i>,
ii. 409). &ldquo;Twelve priests should stand about the bishop,
holding in their hands lighted torches, which at the conclusion
of the anathema or excommunication they should cast down
and trample under foot.&rdquo; When the excommunication is removed,
the symbol of reconciliation is the handing to the penitent of a
burning taper.</p>
</div>

<p>As a result of the Reformation the use of ceremonial lights
was either greatly modified, or totally abolished in the Protestant
<span class="sidenote">Protestant Churches.</span>
Churches. In the Reformed (Calvinistic) Churches
altar lights were, with the rest, done away with entirely
as popish and superstitious. In the Lutheran
Churches they were retained, and in Evangelical Germany
have even survived most of the other medieval rites and
ceremonies (<i>e.g.</i> the use of vestments) which were not abolished
at the Reformation itself.</p>

<p>In the Church of England the practice has been less consistent.
The first Prayer-book of Edward VI. directed two lights to be
placed on the altar. This direction was omitted in the
second Prayer-book; but the &ldquo;Ornaments Rubric&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Church of England.</span>
of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Prayer-book seemed again
to make them obligatory. The question of how far this did
so is a much-disputed one and is connected with the whole
problem of the meaning and scope of the rubric (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>).
An equal uncertainty reigns with regard to the actual usage of
the Church of England from the Reformation onwards. Lighted
candles certainly continued to decorate the holy table in Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s chapel, to the scandal of Protestant zealots. They
also seem to have been retained, at least for a while, in certain
cathedral and collegiate churches. There is, however, no mention
of ceremonial candles in the detailed account of the services of
the Church of England given by William Harrison (<i>Description
of England</i>, 1570); and the attitude of the Church towards their
use, until the ritualistic movement of the 17th century, would
seem to be authoritatively expressed in the <i>Third Part of the
Sermon against Peril of Idolatry</i>, which quotes with approval
the views of Lactantius and compares &ldquo;our Candle Religion&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page678" id="page678"></a>678</span>
with the &ldquo;Gentiles Idolators.&rdquo; This pronouncement, indeed,
though it certainly condemns the use of ceremonial lights in
most of its later developments, and especially the conception
of them as votive offerings whether to God or to the saints,
does not necessarily exclude, though it undoubtedly discourages,
their purely symbolical use.<a name="fa20c" id="fa20c" href="#ft20c"><span class="sp">20</span></a> In this connexion it is worth
pointing out that the homily against idolatry was reprinted,
without alteration and by the king&rsquo;s authority, long after altar
lights had been restored under the influence of the high church
party supreme at court. Illegal under the Act of Uniformity
they seem never to have been. The use of &ldquo;wax lights and
tapers&rdquo; formed one of the indictments brought by P. Smart,
a Puritan prebendary of Durham, against Dr Burgoyne, Cosin
and others for setting up &ldquo;superstitious ceremonies&rdquo; in the
cathedral &ldquo;contrary to the Act of Uniformity.&rdquo; The indictments
were dismissed in 1628 by Sir James Whitelocke, chief
justice of Chester and a judge of the King&rsquo;s Bench, and in 1629
by Sir Henry Yelverton, a judge of Common Pleas and himself
a strong Puritan (see <i>Hierurgia Anglicana</i>, ii pp. 230 seq.). The
use of ceremonial lights was among the indictments in the
impeachment of Laud and other bishops by the House of
Commons, but these were not based on the Act of Uniformity.
From the Restoration onwards the use of ceremonial lights,
though far from universal, was not unusual in cathedrals and
collegiate churches.<a name="fa21c" id="fa21c" href="#ft21c"><span class="sp">21</span></a> It was not, however, till the ritual revival
of the 19th century that their use was at all widely extended
in parish churches. The growing custom met with fierce opposition;
the law was appealed to, and in 1872 the Privy Council
declared altar lights to be illegal (<i>Martin</i> v. <i>Mackonochie</i>).
This judgment, founded as was afterwards admitted on insufficient
knowledge, produced no effect; and, in the absence of any
authoritative pronouncement, advantage was taken of the
ambiguous language of the Ornaments Rubric to introduce
into many churches practically the whole ceremonial use of
lights as practised in the pre-Reformation Church. The matter
was again raised in the case of <i>Read and others</i> v. <i>the Bishop
of Lincoln</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lincoln Judgment</a></span>), one of the counts of the
indictment being that the bishop had, during the celebration
of Holy Communion, allowed two candles to be alight on a shelf
or retable behind the communion table when they were not
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Lincoln Judgment.&rdquo;</span>
necessary for giving light. The archbishop of Canterbury,
in whose court the case was heard (1889), decided
that the mere presence of two candles on the table,
burning during the service but lit before it began,
was lawful under the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI. and had
never been made unlawful. On the case being appealed to the
Privy Council, this particular indictment was dismissed on the
ground that the vicar, not the bishop, was responsible for the
presence of the lights, the general question of the legality of
altar lights being discreetly left open.</p>

<p>The custom of placing lighted candles round the bodies
of the dead, especially when &ldquo;lying in state,&rdquo; has never wholly
died out in Protestant countries, though their significance
has long been lost sight of.<a name="fa22c" id="fa22c" href="#ft22c"><span class="sp">22</span></a> In the 18th century, moreover,
it was still customary in England to accompany a funeral with
lighted tapers. Picart (<i>op. cit.</i> 1737) gives a plate representing
a funeral cortège preceded and accompanied by boys, each carrying
four lighted candles in a branched candlestick. There
seems to be no record of candles having been carried in other
processions in England since the Reformation. The usage
in this respect in some &ldquo;ritualistic&rdquo; churches is a revival of
pre-Reformation ceremonial.</p>

of candles was by no means universal is proved by the 9th canon of
the council of Toledo (671), &ldquo;De benedicendo cereo et lucerna in privilegiis

blessing of candles on the Feast of the Purification of the B.V.M.
(Candlemas, <i>q.v.</i>). (1) &ldquo;O holy Lord, ... who ... by the command
didst cause this liquid to come by the labour of bees to the
perfection of wax, ... we beseech thee ... to bless and sanctify
these candles for the use of men, and the health of bodies and
souls....&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;... these candles, which we thy servants desire to
carry lighted to magnify thy name; that by offering them to thee,
being worthily inflamed with the holy fire of thy most sweet charity,
we may deserve,&rdquo; &amp;c. (3) &ldquo;O Lord Jesus Christ, the true light, ...
mercifully grant, that as these lights enkindled with visible fire
dispel nocturnal darkness, so our hearts illumined by invisible fire,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (<i>Missale Rom.</i>). In the form for the blessing of candles <i>extra
diem Purificationis B. Mariae Virg.</i> the virtue of the consecrated
candles in discomfiting demons is specially brought out: &ldquo;that in
whatever places they may be lighted, or placed, the princes of darkness
may depart, and tremble, and may fly terror-stricken with all
their ministers from those habitations, nor presume further to
disquiet and molest those who serve thee, Almighty God&rdquo; (<i>Rituale
Rom.</i>).</p>

<p><a name="ft17c" id="ft17c" href="#fa17c"><span class="fn">17</span></a> Altar candlesticks consist of five parts: the foot, stem, knob
in the centre, bowl to catch the drippings, and pricket (a sharp
point on which the candle is fixed). It is permissible to use a long
tube, pointed to imitate a candle, in which is a small taper forced
to the top by a spring (<i>Cong. Rit.</i>, 11th May 1878).</p>

<p><a name="ft18c" id="ft18c" href="#fa18c"><span class="fn">18</span></a> This is common to the Eastern Church also. Pilgrims from all
parts of the East flock to Jerusalem to obtain the &ldquo;new fire&rdquo; on
Easter Eve at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Here the fire is
supposed to be miraculously sent from heaven. The rush of the
pilgrims to kindle their lights at it is so great, that order is maintained
with difficulty by Mahommedan soldiers.</p>

<p><a name="ft19c" id="ft19c" href="#fa19c"><span class="fn">19</span></a> The origin of the Paschal Candle is lost in the mists of antiquity.
According to the abbé Châtelain (quoted in Diderot&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopédie,
s.v.</i> &ldquo;Cièrge&rdquo;) the Paschal Candle was not originally a candle at
all, but a wax column on which the dates of the movable feasts
were inscribed. These were later written on paper and fixed to the
Paschal Candle, a custom which in his day survived in the Cluniac
churches.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGNE, CHARLES JOSEPH,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> <span class="sc">Prince de</span> (1735-1814), soldier
and writer, came of a princely family of Hainaut, and was born
at Brussels in 1735. As an Austrian subject he entered the
imperial army at an early age. He distinguished himself by
his valour in the Seven Years&rsquo; War, notably at Breslau, Leuthen,
Hochkirch and Maxen, and after the war rose rapidly to the
rank of lieutenant field marshal. He became the intimate
friend and counsellor of the emperor Joseph II., and, inheriting
his father&rsquo;s vast estates, lived in the greatest splendour and
luxury till the War of the Bavarian Succession brought him
again into active service. This war was short and uneventful,
and the prince then travelled in England, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland and France, devoting himself impartially to the
courts, the camps, the salons and the learned assemblies of
philosophers and scientists in each country. In 1784 he was
again employed in military work, and was promoted to Feldzeugmeister.
In 1787 he was with Catherine II. in Russia, accompanied
her in her journey to the Crimea, and was made
a Russian field marshal by the empress. In 1788 he was present
at the siege of Belgrade. Shortly after this he was invited
to place himself at the head of the Belgian revolutionary movement,
in which one of his sons and many of his relatives were
prominent, but declined with great courtesy, saying that &ldquo;he
never revolted in the winter.&rdquo; Though suspected by Joseph
of collusion with the rebels, the two friends were not long estranged,
and after the death of the emperor the prince remained
in Vienna. His Brabant estates were overrun by the French
in 1792-1793, and his eldest son killed in action at La Croix-du-Bois
in the Argonne (September 14, 1792). He was given the
rank of field marshal (1809) and an honorary command at court,
living in spite of the loss of his estates in comparative luxury
and devoting himself to literary work. He lived long enough
to characterize the proceedings of the congress of Vienna with
the famous <i>mot</i>: &ldquo;Le Congrès danse mais ne marche pas.&rdquo;
He died at Vienna on the 13th of December 1814. His grandson,
Eugene Lamoral de Ligne (1804-1880), was a distinguished
Belgian statesman.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His collected works appeared in thirty-four volumes at Vienna
during the last years of his life (<i>Mélanges militaires</i>, <i>littéraires</i>,
<i>sentimentaires</i>), and he bequeathed his manuscripts to the emperor&rsquo;s
Trabant Guard, of which he was captain (<i>&OElig;uvres posthumes</i>, Dresden
and Vienna, 1817). Selections were published in French and
German (<i>&OElig;uvres choisies de M. le prince de Ligne</i> (Paris, 1809);
<i>Lettres et pensées du Maréchal Prince de Ligne</i>, ed. by Madame de
Staël (1809); <i>&OElig;uvres historiques, littéraires ... correspondance et
poésies diverses</i> (Brussels, 1859); <i>Des Prinzen Karl von Ligne
militärische Werke</i>, ed. Count Pappenheim (Sulzbach, 1814). The
most important of his numerous works on all military subjects is
the <i>Fantaisies et préjugés militaires</i>, which originally appeared in
1780. A modern edition is that published by J. Dumaine (Paris,
1879). A German version (<i>Militärische Vorurtheile und Phantasien</i>,
&amp;c.) appeared as early as 1783. This work, though it deals lightly
and cavalierly with the most important subjects (the prince even

British Field Marshal, came of a Huguenot family of
Castres in the south of France, members of which emigrated
to England at the close of the 17th century. He entered the army
as a volunteer under Marlborough. From 1702 to 1710 he was
engaged, with distinction, in nearly every important battle
and siege of the war. He was one of the first to mount the
breach at the siege of Liége, commanded a company at the
Schellenberg and at Blenheim, and was present at Menin (where
he led the storming of the covered way), Ramillies, Oudenarde
and Malplaquet (where he received twenty-three bullets through
his clothing and remained unhurt). In 1712 he became governor
of Fort St Philip, Minorca, and in 1718 was adjutant-general
of the troops employed in the Vigo expedition, where he led the
stormers of Fort Marin. Two years later he became colonel
of the &ldquo;Black Horse&rdquo; (now 7th Dragoon Guards), a command
which he retained for 29 years. His regiment soon attained
an extraordinary degree of efficiency. He was made brigadier-general
in 1735, major-general in 1739, and accompanied Lord
Stair in the Rhine Campaign of 1742-1743. George II. made
him a Knight of the Bath on the field of Dettingen. At Fontenoy
Ligonier commanded the British foot, and acted throughout
the battle as adviser to the duke of Cumberland. During the
&ldquo;Forty-Five&rdquo; he was called home to command the British army
in the Midlands, but in January 1746 was placed at the head
of the British and British-paid contingents of the Allied army
in the Low Countries. He was present at Roucoux (11th Oct.
1746), and, as general of horse, at Val (1st July 1747), where
he led the last charge of the British cavalry. In this encounter
his horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner, but was exchanged
in a few days. With the close of the campaign ended
Ligonier&rsquo;s active career, but (with a brief interval in 1756-1757)
he occupied various high civil and military posts to the close
of his life. In 1757 he was made, in rapid succession, commander-in-chief,
colonel of the 1st Foot Guards (now Grenadier Guards),
and a peer of Ireland under the title of Viscount Ligonier of
Enniskillen, a title changed in 1762 for that of Clonmell. From
1759 to 1762 he was master-general of the Ordnance, and in
1763 he became Baron, and in 1766 Earl, in the English peerage.
In the latter year he became field marshal. He died in 1770.
His younger brother, Francis, was also a distinguished
soldier; and his son succeeded to the Irish peerage of Lord
Ligonier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGUORI, ALFONSO MARIA DEI<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (1696-1787), saint and
doctor of the Church of Rome, was born at Marianella, near
Naples, on the 27th of September 1696, being the son of Giuseppe
dei Liguori, a Neapolitan noble. He began life at the bar,
where he obtained considerable practice; but the loss of an
important suit, in which he was counsel for a Neapolitan noble
against the grand duke of Tuscany, and in which he had entirely
mistaken the force of a leading document, so mortified him
that he withdrew from the legal world. In 1726 he entered
the Congregation of Missions as a novice, and became a priest
in 1726. In 1732 he founded the &ldquo;Congregation of the Most
Holy Redeemer&rdquo; at Scala, near Salerno; the headquarters
of the Order were afterwards transferred to Nocera dei Pagani.
Its members, popularly called Liguorians or Redemptorists,
devote themselves to the religious instruction of the poor, more
especially in country districts; Liguori specially forbade them
to undertake secular educational work. In 1750 appeared his
celebrated devotional book on the <i>Glories of Mary</i>; three
years later came his still more celebrated treatise on moral
theology. In 1755 this was much enlarged and translated into
Latin under the title of <i>Homo Apostolicus</i>. In 1762, at the
express desire of the pope, he accepted the bishopric of Sant&rsquo;
Agata dei Goti, a small town in the province of Benevent;
though he had previously refused the archbishopric of Palermo.
Here he worked diligently at practical reforms, being specially
anxious to raise the standard of clerical life and work. In 1775
he resigned his bishopric on the plea of enfeebled health; he
retired to his Redemptorists at Nocera, and died there in 1787.
In 1796 Pius VI. declared him &ldquo;venerable&rdquo;; he was beatified
by Pius VII. in 1816, canonized by Gregory XVI. in 1839, and
finally declared one of the nineteen &ldquo;Doctors of the Church&rdquo;
by Pius IX. in 1871.</p>

<p>Liguori is the chief representative of a school of casuistry and
devotional theology still abundantly represented within the
Roman Church. Not that he was in any sense its founder.
He was simply a fair representative of the Italian piety of his
day&mdash;amiable, ascetic in his personal habits, indefatigable in
many forms of activity, and of more than respectable abilities;
though the emotional side of his character had the predominance
over his intellect. He was learned, as learning was understood
among the Italian clergy of the 18th century; but he was
destitute of critical faculty, and the inaccuracy of his quotations
is proverbial. In his casuistical works he was a diligent compiler,
whose avowed design was to take a middle course between the
two current extremes of severity and laxity. In practice, he
leant constantly towards laxity. Eighteenth-century Italy
looked on religion with apathetic indifference, and Liguori
convinced himself that only the gentlest and most lenient
treatment could win back the alienated laity; hence he was
always willing to excuse errors on the side of laxity as due to an
excess of zeal in winning over penitents. Severity, on the other
hand, seemed to him not only inexpedient, but positively wrong.
By making religion hard it made it odious, and thus prepared
the way for unbelief. Like all casuists, he took for granted that
morality was a recondite science, beyond the reach of all but the
learned. When a layman found himself in doubt, his duty was
not to consult his conscience, but to take the advice of his
confessor; while the confessor himself was bound to follow the
rules laid down by the casuistical experts, who delivered themselves
of a kind of &ldquo;counsel&rsquo;s opinion&rdquo; on all knotty points of
practical morality. But experts proverbially differ: what was
to be done when they disagreed? Suppose, for instance, that
some casuists held it wrong to dance on Sunday, while others
held it perfectly lawful. In Liguori&rsquo;s time there were four ways
of answering the question. Strict moralists&mdash;called rigorists,
or &ldquo;tutiorists&rdquo;&mdash;maintained that the austerer opinion ought
always to be followed; dancing on Sundays was certainly wrong,
if any good authorities had declared it to be so. Probabiliorists
maintained that the more general opinion ought to prevail,
irrespectively of whether it was the stricter or the laxer; dancing
on Sunday was perfectly lawful, if the majority of casuists
approved it. Probabilists argued that any opinion might be
followed, if it could show good authority on its side, even if
there was still better authority against it; dancing on Sunday
must be innocent, if it could show a fair sprinkling of eminent
names in its favour. The fourth and last school&mdash;the &ldquo;laxists&rdquo;&mdash;carried
this principle a step farther, and held that a practice
must be unobjectionable, if it could prove that any one &ldquo;grave
Doctor&rdquo; had defended it; even if dancing on Sunday had
hitherto lain under the ban of the church, a single casuist could
legitimate it by one stroke of his pen. Liguori&rsquo;s great achievement
lay in steering a middle course between these various
extremes. The gist of his system, which is known as &ldquo;equi-probabilism,&rdquo;
is that the more indulgent opinion may always
be followed, whenever the authorities in its favour are as good,
or nearly as good, as those on the other side. In this way he
claimed that he had secured liberty in its rights without
allowing it to degenerate into licence. However much they might
personally disapprove, zealous priests could not forbid their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page680" id="page680"></a>680</span>
parishioners to dance on Sunday, if the practice had won widespread
toleration; on the other hand, they could not relax
the usual discipline of the church on the strength of a few
unguarded opinions of too indulgent casuists. Thus the Liguorian
system surpassed all its predecessors in securing uniformity
in the confessional on a basis of established usage, two advantages
amply sufficient to ensure its speedy general adoption within
the Church of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGURES BAEBIANI,<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> in ancient geography, a settlement of
Ligurians in Samnium, Italy. The towns of Taurasia and
Cisauna in Samnium had been captured in 298 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the consul
L. Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, and the territory of the former
remained Roman state domain. In 180 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> 47,000 Ligurians
from the neighbourhood of Luna (Ligures Apuani), with women
and children, were transferred to this district, and two settlements
were formed taking their names from the consuls of 181 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
the Ligures Baebiani and the Ligures Corneliani. The site of the
former town lies 15 m. N. of Beneventum, on the road to Saepinum
and Aesernia. In its ruins several inscriptions have been found,
notably a large bronze tablet discovered in a public building
in the Forum bearing the date <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 101, and relating to the
alimentary institution founded by Trajan here (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Veleia</a></span>).
A sum of money was lent to landed proprietors of the district
(whose names and estates are specified in the inscription), and
the interest which it produced formed the income of the institution,
which, on the model of that of Veleia, would have served
to support a little over one hundred children. The capital was
401,800 sesterces, and the annual interest probably at 5%,
<i>i.e.</i> 20,090 sesterces (£4018 and £201 respectively). The site
of the other settlement&mdash;that of the Ligures Corneliani&mdash;is
unknown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGURIA,<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> a modern territorial division of Italy, lying between
the Ligurian Alps and the Apennines on the N., and the Mediterranean
on the S. and extending from the frontier of France on
the W. to the Gulf of Spezia on the E. Its northern limits touch
Piedmont and Lombardy, while Emilia and Tuscany fringe
its eastern borders, the dividing line following as a rule the
summits of the mountains. Its area is 2037 sq. m. The railway
from Pisa skirts the entire coast of the territory, throwing off
lines to Parma from Sarzana and Spezia, to Milan and Turin
from Genoa, and to Turin from Savona, and there is a line from
Ventimiglia to Cuneo and Turin by the Col di Tenda. Liguria
embraces the two provinces of Genoa and Porto Maurizio
(Imperia), which once formed the republic of Genoa. Its
sparsely-peopled mountains slope gently northward towards
the Po, descending, however, abruptly into the sea at several
points; the narrow coast district, famous under the name of
the Riviera (<i>q.v.</i>), is divided at Genoa into the Riviera di Ponente
towards France, and the Riviera di Levante towards the east.
Its principal products are wheat, maize, wine, oranges, lemons,
fruits, olives and potatoes, though the olive groves are being
rapidly supplanted by flower-gardens, which grow flowers for
export. Copper and iron pyrites are mined. The principal
industries are iron-works, foundries, iron shipbuilding, engineering,
and boiler works (Genoa, Spezia, Sampierdarena, Sestri
Ponente, &amp;c.), the production of cocoons, and the manufacture
of cottons and woollens. Owing to the sheltered situation and
the mildness of their climate, many of the coast towns are
chosen by thousands of foreigners for winter residence, while
the Italians frequent them in summer for sea-bathing. The
inhabitants have always been adventurous seamen&mdash;Columbus
and Amerigo Vespucci were Genoese,&mdash;and the coast has several
good harbours, Genoa, Spezia and Savona being the best. In
educational and general development, Liguria stands high
among the regions of Italy. The populations of the respective
provinces and their chief towns are, according to the census
of 1901 (<i>popolazione residente</i> or <i>legale</i>)&mdash;province of Genoa,
pop. 931,156; number of communes 197; chief towns&mdash;Genoa
(219,507), Spezia (66,263), Savona (38,648), Sampierdarena
(34,084), Sestri Ponente (17,225). Province of Porto Maurizio,
pop. 144,604, number of communes 106; chief towns&mdash;Porto
Maurizio (7207), S. Remo (20,027), Ventimiglia (11,468), Oneglia
(8252). Total for Liguria, 1,075,760.</p>

<p>The Ligurian coast became gradually subject to the Romans,
and the road along it must have been correspondingly prolonged:
up to the end of the Hannibalic war the regular starting-point
for Spain by sea was Pisae, in 195 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was the harbour of Luna
(Gulf of Spezia),<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> though Genua must have become Roman a
little before this time, while, in 137 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, C. Hostilius Mancinus
marched as far as Portus Herculis (Villafranca), and in 121 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
the province of Gallia Narbonensis was formed and the coast-road
prolonged to the Pyrenees. In 14 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Augustus restored the
whole road from Placentia to Dertona (Via Postumia), and
thence to Vada Sabatia (Via Aemilia[2]) and the River Varus
(Var), so that it thenceforth took the name of Via Julia Augusta
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aemilia, Via</a></span>[2]). The other chief roads of Liguria were
the portion of the Via Postumia from Dertona to Genua, a road
from above Vada through Augusta Bagiennorum and Pollentia
to Augusta Taurinorum, and another from Augusta Taurinorum
to Hasta and Valentia. The names of the villages&mdash;Quarto,
Quinto, &amp;c.&mdash;on the south-east side and Pontedecimo on the
north of Genoa allude to their distance along the Roman roads.
The Roman Liguria, forming the ninth region of Augustus, was
thus far more extensive than the modern, including the country
on the north slopes of the Apennines and Maritime Alps between
the Trebia and the Po, and extending a little beyond Albintimilium.
On the west Augustus formed the provinces of the
Alpes Maritimae and the Alpes Cottiae. Towns of importance
were few, owing to the nature of the country. Dertona was
the only colony, and Alba Pompeia, Augusta Bagiennorum,
Pollentia, Hasta, Aquae Statiellae, and Genua may also be
mentioned; but the Ligurians dwelt entirely in villages, and
were organized as tribes. The mountainous character of Liguria
made the spread of culture difficult; it remained a forest district,
producing timber, cattle, ponies, mules, sheep, &amp;c. Oil and
wine had to be imported, and when the cultivation of the olive
began is not known.</p>

<p>The arrangement made by Augustus lasted until the time
of Diocletian, when the two Alpine provinces were abolished,
and the watershed became the boundary between Italy and
Gaul. At this time we find the name Liguria extended as far
as Milan, while in the 6th century the old Liguria was separated
from it, and under the Lombards formed the fifth Italian province
under the name of Alpes Cottiae. In the middle ages the ancient
Liguria north of the Apennines fell to Piedmont and Lombardy,
while that to the south, with the coast strip, belonged to the
republic of Genoa.</p>
<div class="author">(T. As.)</div>

<p><i>Archaeology and Philology.</i>&mdash;It is clear that in earlier times
the Ligurians occupied a much more extensive area than the
Augustan region; for instance Strabo (i. 2, 92; iv. 1, 7) gives
earlier authorities for their possession of the land on which the
Greek colony of Massalia (Marseilles) was founded; and Thucydides
(vi. 2) speaks of a settlement of Ligurians in Spain who
expelled the Sicani thence. Southward their domain extended
as far as Pisa on the coast of Etruria and Arretium inland in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page681" id="page681"></a>681</span>
time of Polybius (ii. 6), and a somewhat vague reference in
Lycophron (line 1351) to the Ligurians as enemies of the founders
of Agylla (<i>i.e.</i> Caere) suggests that they once occupied even a
larger tract to the south. Seneca (<i>Cons. ad Helv.</i> vii. 9), states
that the population of Corsica was partly Ligurian. By combining
traditions recorded by Dionysius (i. 22; xiv. 37) and others
(<i>e.g.</i> Serv. <i>ad. Aen.</i> xi. 317) as having been held by Cato the
Censor and by Philistus of Syracuse (385 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) respectively,
Professor Ridgeway (<i>Who were the Romans?</i> London, 1908, p. 3)
decides in favour of identifying the Ligurians with a tribe called
the Aborigines who occupy a large place in the early traditions
of Italy (see Dionysius i. cc. 10 ff.); and who may at all events be
regarded with reasonable certainty as constituting an early
pre-Roman and pre-Tuscan stratum in the population of Central
Italy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Latium</a></span>). For a discussion of this question see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volsci</a></span>.
Ridgeway holds that the language of the Ligurians, as well as
their antiquities, was identical with that of the early Latins, and
with that of the Plebeians of Rome (as contrasted with that
of the Patrician or Sabine element), see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i> (<i>ad.
init.</i>). The archaeological side of this important question is
difficult. Although great progress has been made with the study
of the different strata of remains in prehistoric Italy and of
those of Liguria itself (see for instance the excellent <i>Introduction
à l&rsquo;histoire romaine</i> by Basile Modestov (Paris, 1907, p. 122 ff.)
and W. Ridgeway&rsquo;s <i>Early Age of Greece</i>, p. 240 ff.) no general
agreement has been reached among archaeologists as to the
particular races who are to be identified as the authors of the
early strata, earlier, that is, than that stratum which represents
the Etruscans.</p>

<p>On the linguistic side some fairly certain conclusions have
been reached. D&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville (<i>Les Premiers habitants
de l&rsquo;Europe</i>, ed. 2, Paris, 1880-1894) pointed out the great
frequency of the suffix -<i>asco</i>- (and -<i>usco</i>-) both in ancient and in
modern Ligurian districts, and as far north as <i>Caranusca</i> near
Metz, and also in the eastern Alps and in Spain. He pointed
out also, what can scarcely be doubted, that the great mass of
the Ligurian proper names (<i>e.g.</i> the streams <i>Vinelasca</i>, <i>Porcobera</i>,
<i>Comberanea</i>; <i>mons Tuledo</i>; <i>Venascum</i>), have a definite Indo-European
character. Farther Karl Müllenhof in vol. iii. of his
<i>Deutsche Alterthumskunde</i> (Berlin, 1898) made a careful collection
of the proper names reserved in Latin inscriptions of the Ligurian
districts, such as the <i>Tabula Genuatium</i> (<i>C.I.L.</i> i. 99) of 117 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
A complete collection of all Ligurian place and personal names
known has been made by S. Elizabeth Jackson, B.A., and the
collection is to be combined with the inscriptional remains of
the district in <i>The Pre-Italic Dialects</i>, edited by R. S. Conway
(see <i>The Proceedings of the British Academy</i>). Following
Kretschmer <i>Kuhn&rsquo;s Zeitschrift</i> (xxxviii. 97), who discussed
several inscriptions found near Ornavasso (Lago Maggiore) and
concluded that they showed an Indo-European language, Conway,
though holding that the inscriptions are more Celtic than
Ligurian, pointed out strong evidence in the ancient place names
of Liguria that the language spoken there in the period which
preceded the Roman conquest was Indo-European, and belonged
to a definite group, namely, languages which preserved the
original <i>q</i> as Latin did, and did not convert it into <i>p</i> as did the
Umbro-Safine tribes. The same is probably true of Venetia
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Veneti</a></span>), and of an Indo-European language preserved
on inscriptions found at Coligny and commonly referred to the
Sequani (see <i>Comptes Rendus de l&rsquo;Ac. d&rsquo;Insc.</i>, Paris, 1897, 703;
E. B. Nicholson, <i>Sequanian</i>, London, 1898; Thurneysen,
<i>Zeitschr. f. Kelt. Phil.</i>, 1899, 523). Typically Ligurian names
are <i>Quiamelius</i>, which contains the characteristic Ligurian
word <i>melo</i>- &ldquo;stone&rdquo; as in <i>mons Blustiemelus</i> (<i>C.I.L.</i> v. 7749),
<i>Intimelium</i> and the modern <i>Vintimiglia</i>. The tribal names
<i>Soliceli</i>, <i>Stoniceli</i>, clearly contain the same element as Lat.
<i>aequi-coli</i> (dwellers on the plain), <i>sati-cola</i>, &amp;c., namely <i>quel</i>-, cf.
Lat. <i>in-quil-inus</i>, <i>colo</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="polein, tellesthai">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, &#964;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>. And it should
be added that the Ligurian ethnica show the prevailing use
of the two suffixes -<i>co</i>- and -<i>ati</i>-, which there is reason to
refer to the pre-Roman stratum of population in Italy (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volsci</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LI HUNG CHANG<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1823-1901), Chinese statesman, was born
on the 16th of February 1823 at Hofei, in Ngan-hui. From his
earliest youth he showed marked ability, and when quite young
he took his bachelor degree. In 1847 he became a Tsin-shi, or
graduate of the highest order, and two years later was admitted
into the imperial Hanlin college. Shortly after this the central
provinces of the empire were invaded by the Taiping rebels, and
in defence of his native district he raised a regiment of militia,
with which he did such good service to the imperial cause that he
attracted the attention of Tsêng Kuo-fan, the generalissimo in
command. In 1859 he was transferred to the province of Fu-kien,
where he was given the rank of taotai, or intendant of circuit.
But Tsêng had not forgotten him, and at his request Li was
recalled to take part against the rebels. He found his cause
supported by the &ldquo;Ever Victorious Army,&rdquo; which, after having
been raised by an American named Ward, was finally placed
under the command of Charles George Gordon. With this
support Li gained numerous victories leading to the surrender of
Suchow and the capture of Nanking. For these exploits he was
made governor of Kiangsu, was decorated with a yellow jacket,
and was created an earl. An incident connected with the surrender
of Suchow, however, left a lasting stain upon his character.
By an arrangement with Gordon the rebel wangs, or princes,
yielded Nanking on condition that their lives should be spared.
In spite of the assurance given them by Gordon, Li ordered their
instant execution. This breach of faith so aroused Gordon&rsquo;s
indignation that he seized a rifle, intending to shoot the falsifier
of his word, and would have done so had not Li saved himself by
flight. On the suppression of the rebellion (1864) Li took up his
duties as governor, but was not long allowed to remain in civil
life. On the outbreak of the rebellion of the Nienfei, a remnant
of the Taipings, in Ho-nan and Shan-tung (1866) he was ordered
again to take the field, and after some misadventures he succeeded
in suppressing the movement. A year later he was appointed
viceroy of Hukwang, where he remained until 1870, when the
Tientsin massacre necessitated his transfer to the scene of the
outrage. He was, as a natural consequence, appointed to the
viceroyalty of the metropolitan province of Chihli, and justified
his appointment by the energy with which he suppressed all
attempts to keep alive the anti-foreign sentiment among the
people. For his services he was made imperial tutor and member
of the grand council of the empire, and was decorated with
many-eyed peacocks&rsquo; feathers.</p>

<p>To his duties as viceroy were added those of the superintendent
of trade, and from that time until his death, with a few intervals of
retirement, he practically conducted the foreign policy of China.
He concluded the Chifu convention with Sir Thomas Wade (1876),
and thus ended the difficulty caused by the murder of Mr Margary
in Yunnan; he arranged treaties with Peru and Japan, and he
actively directed the Chinese policy in Korea. On the death of the
emperor T&rsquo;ungchi in 1875 he, by suddenly introducing a large
armed force into the capital, effected a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> by which the
emperor Kwang Sü was put on the throne under the tutelage of
the two dowager empresses; and in 1886, on the conclusion of
the Franco-Chinese war, he arranged a treaty with France. Li
was always strongly impressed with the necessity of strengthening
the empire, and when viceroy of Chihli he raised a large well-drilled
and well-armed force, and spent vast sums both in fortifying Port
Arthur and the Taku forts and in increasing the navy. For years
he had watched the successful reforms effected in Japan and had a
well-founded dread of coming into conflict with that empire. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page682" id="page682"></a>682</span>
in 1894 events forced his hand, and in consequence of a dispute
as to the relative influence of China and Japan in Korea, war
broke out. The result proved the wisdom of Li&rsquo;s fears. Both on
land and at sea the Chinese forces were ignominiously routed,
and in 1895, on the fall of Wei-hai-wei, the emperor sued for
peace. With characteristic subterfuge his advisers suggested as
peace envoys persons whom the mikado very properly and
promptly refused to accept, and finally Li was sent to represent
his imperial master at the council assembled at Shimonoseki.
With great diplomatic skill Li pleaded the cause of his country,
but finally had to agree to the cession of Formosa, the Pescadores,
and the Liaotung peninsula to the conquerors, and to the payment
of an indemnity of 200,000,000 taels. By a subsequent
arrangement the Liaotung peninsula was restored to China, in
exchange for an increased indemnity. During the peace discussions
at Shimonoseki, as Li was being borne through the narrow
streets of the town, a would-be assassin fired a pistol point-blank
in his face. The wound inflicted was not serious, and after a few
days&rsquo; rest Li was able to take up again the suspended negotiations.
In 1896 he represented the emperor at the coronation of the tsar,
and visited Germany, Belgium, France, England, and the United
States of America. For some time after his return to China his
services were demanded at Peking, where he was virtually constituted
minister for foreign affairs; but in 1900 he was transferred
to Canton as viceroy of the two Kwangs. The Boxer
movement, however, induced the emperor to recall him to the
capital, and it was mainly owing to his exertions that, at the
conclusion of the outbreak, a protocol of peace was signed in
September 1901. For many months his health had been failing,
and he died on the 7th of November 1901. He left three sons
and one daughter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILAC,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span><a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> or <span class="sc">Pipe Tree</span> (<i>Syringa vulgaris</i>), a tree of the olive
family, Oleaceae. The genus contains about ten species of
ornamental hardy deciduous shrubs native in eastern Europe and
temperate Asia. They have opposite, generally entire leaves and
large panicles of small regular flowers, with a bell-shaped calyx
and a 4-lobed cylindrical corolla, with the two stamens characteristic
of the order attached at the mouth of the tube. The common
lilac is said to have come from Persia in the 16th century,
but is doubtfully indigenous in Hungary, the borders of Moldavia,
&amp;c. Two kinds of <i>Syringa</i>, viz. <i>alba</i> and <i>caerulea</i>, are figured and
described by Gerard (<i>Herball</i>, 1597), which he calls the white and
the blue pipe privets. The former is the common privet, <i>Ligustrum
vulgare</i>, which, and the ash tree, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, are the
only members of the family native in Great Britain. The latter is
the lilac, as both figure and description agree accurately with it.
It was carried by the European colonists to north-east America,
and is still grown in gardens of the northern and middle states.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are many fine varieties of lilac, both with single and double
flowers; they are among the commonest and most beautiful of
spring-flowering shrubs. The so-called Persian lilac of gardens
(<i>S. dubia</i>, <i>S. chinensis</i> var. <i>Rothomagensis</i>), also known as the
Chinese or Rouen lilac, a small shrub 4 to 6 ft. high with intense
violet flowers appearing in May and June, is considered to be a
hybrid between <i>S. vulgaris</i> and <i>S. persica</i>&mdash;the true Persian lilac,
a native of Persia and Afghanistan, a shrub 4 to 7 ft. high with
bluish-purple or white flowers. Of other species, <i>S. Josikaea</i>, from
Transylvania, has scentless bluish-purple flowers; <i>S. Emodi</i>, a
native of the Himalayas, is a handsome shrub with large ovate leaves
and dense panicles of purple or white strongly scented flowers.
Lilacs grow freely and flower profusely in almost any soil and
situation, but when neglected are apt to become choked with suckers
which shoot up in great numbers from the base. They are readily
propagated by means of these suckers.</p>

<p>Syringa is also a common name for the mock-orange <i>Philadelphus
coronarius</i> (nat. ord. <i>Saxifragaceae</i>), a handsome shrub 2 to 10 ft.
high, with smooth ovate leaves and clusters of white flowers which
have a strong orange-like scent. It is a native of western Asia, and
perhaps some parts of southern Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILBURNE, JOHN<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1614-1657), English political agitator,
was the younger son of a gentleman of good family in the county
of Durham. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to a
clothier in London, but he appears to have early addicted himself
to the &ldquo;contention, novelties, opposition of government, and
violent and bitter expressions&rdquo; for which he afterwards became so
conspicuous as to provoke the saying of Harry Marten (the
regicide) that, &ldquo;if the world was emptied of all but John Lilburn,
Lilburn would quarrel with John, and John with Lilburn.&rdquo;
He appears at one time to have been law-clerk to William Prynne.
In February 1638, for the part he had taken in importing and
circulating <i>The Litany</i> and other publications of John Bastwick
and Prynne, offensive to the bishops, he was sentenced by the
Star Chamber to be publicly whipped from the Fleet prison to
Palace Yard, Westminster, there to stand for two hours in the
pillory, and afterwards to be kept in gaol until a fine of £500 had
been paid. He devoted his enforced leisure to his favourite form
of literary activity, and did not regain his liberty until November
1640, one of the earliest recorded speeches of Oliver Cromwell
being made in support of his petition to the House of Commons
(Nov. 9, 1640). In 1641 he received an indemnity of £3000.
He now entered the army, and in 1642 was taken prisoner at
Brentford and tried for his life; sentence would no doubt have
been executed had not the parliament by threatening reprisals
forced his exchange. He soon rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
but in April 1645, having become dissatisfied with the
predominance of Presbyterianism, and refusing to take the
covenant, he resigned his commission, presenting at the same
time to the Commons a petition for considerable arrears of pay.
His violent language in Westminster Hall about the speaker
and other public men led in the following July to his arrest and
committal to Newgate, whence he was discharged, however,
without trial, by order of the House, in October. In January
1647 he was committed to the Tower for accusations against
Cromwell, but was again set at liberty in time to become a
disappointed spectator of the failure of the &ldquo;Levellers&rdquo; or
ultrademocratic party in the army at the Ware rendezvous in
the following November. The scene produced a deep impression
on his mind, and in February 1649 he along with other petitioners
presented to the House of Commons a paper entitled <i>The Serious
Apprehensions of a part of the People on behalf of the Commonwealth</i>,
which he followed up with a pamphlet, <i>England&rsquo;s New
Chains Discovered</i>, criticizing Ireton, and another exposing the
conduct of Cromwell, Ireton and other leaders of the army since
June 1647 (<i>The Hunting of the Foxes from Newmarket and Triploe
Heath to Whitehall by Five Small Beagles</i>, the &ldquo;beagles&rdquo; being
Lilburne, Richard Overton, William Walwyn, Prince and
another). Finally, the <i>Second Part of England&rsquo;s New Chains
Discovered</i>, a violent outburst against &ldquo;the dominion of a council
of state, and a constitution of a new and unexperienced nature,&rdquo;
became the subject of discussion in the House, and led anew to
the imprisonment of its author in the Tower on the 11th of April.
His trial in the following October, on a charge of seditious and
scandalous practices against the state, resulted in his unanimous
acquittal, followed by his release in November. In 1650 he
was advocating the release of trade from the restrictions of
chartered companies and monopolists.</p>

<p>In January 1652, for printing and publishing a petition against
Sir Arthur Hesilrige and the Haberdashers&rsquo; Hall for what he
conceived to have been an injury done to his uncle George
Lilburne in 1649, he was sentenced to pay fines amounting to
£7000, and to be banished the Commonwealth, with prohibition
of return under the pain of death. In June 1653 he nevertheless
came back from the Low Countries, where he had busied himself
in pamphleteering and such other agitation as was possible, and
was immediately arrested; the trial, which was protracted from
the 13th of July to the 20th of August, issued in his acquittal,
to the great joy of London, but it was nevertheless thought proper
to keep him in captivity for &ldquo;the peace of the nation.&rdquo; He was
detained successively in the Tower, in Jersey, in Guernsey and
in Dover Castle. At Dover he came under Quaker influence,
and signified his readiness at last to be done with &ldquo;carnal sword
fightings and fleshly bustlings and contests&rdquo;; and in 1655, on
giving security for his good behaviour, he was set free. He now
settled at Eltham in Kent, frequently preaching at Quaker
meetings in the neighbourhood during the brief remainder of
his troubled life. He died on the 29th of August 1657.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page683" id="page683"></a>683</span></p>

<p>His brother, Colonel Robert Lilburne, was among those who
signed the death-warrant of Charles I. In 1656 he was M.P.
for the East Riding of Yorkshire, and at the restoration was
sentenced to lifelong imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILIACEAE<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span>, in botany, a natural order of Monocotyledons
belonging to the series Liliiflorae, and generally regarded as
representing the typical order of Monocotyledons. The plants
are generally perennial herbs growing from a bulb or rhizome,
sometimes shrubby as in butcher&rsquo;s broom (<i>Ruscus</i>) or tree-like
as in species of <i>Dracaena, Yucca</i> or <i>Aloe</i>. The flowers are with
few exceptions hermaphrodite, and regular with parts in threes
(fig. 5), the perianth
which is generally petaloid
occupying the two
outer whorls, followed
by two whorls of
stamens, with a superior
ovary of three carpels
in the centre of the
flower; the ovary is
generally three-chambered
and contains an
indefinite number of
anatropous ovules on
axile placentas (see
fig. 2). The fruit is a
capsule splitting along
the septa (septicidal) (fig. 1), or between them (loculicidal), or a
berry (fig. 6, <i>3</i>); the seeds contain a small embryo in a copious
fleshy or cartilaginous endosperm. Liliaceae is one of the larger
orders of flowering plants containing about 2500 species in 200
genera; it is of world-wide distribution. The plants show great
diversity in vegetative structure, which together with the
character and mode of dehiscence of the fruit afford a basis for
the subdivision of the order into tribes, eleven of which are
recognized. The following are the most important tribes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Melanthoideae.</i>&mdash;The plants have a rhizome or corm, and the
fruit is a capsule. It contains 36 genera, many of which are north
temperate and three are represented in Britain, viz. <i>Tofieldia</i>, an
arctic and alpine genus of small herbs with
a slender scape springing from a tuft of
narrow ensiform leaves and bearing a
raceme of small green flowers; <i>Narthecium</i>
(bog-asphodel), herbs with a habit
similar to <i>Tofieldia</i>, but with larger
golden-yellow flowers; and <i>Colchicum</i>, a
genus with about 30 species including
the meadow saffron or autumn crocus (<i>C.
autumnale</i>). <i>Colchicum</i> illustrates the
corm-development which is rare in
Liliaceae though common in the allied
order Iridaceae; a corm is formed by
swelling at the base of the axis (figs. 3, 4)
and persists after the flowers and leaves,
bearing next season&rsquo;s plant as a lateral
shoot in the axil of a scale-leaf at its
base. <i>Gloriosa</i>, well known in cultivation,
climbs by means of its tendril-like leaf-tips;
it has handsome flowers with
decurved orange-red or yellow petals; it
is a native of tropical Asia and Africa.
<i>Veratrum</i> is an alpine genus of the north
temperate zone.</p>

<p><i>Asphodeloideae.</i>&mdash;The plants generally
have a rhizome bearing radical leaves, as
in asphodel, rarely a stem with a tuft of
leaves as in <i>Aloe</i>, very rarely a tuber
(<i>Eriospermum</i>) or bulb (<i>Bowiea</i>). The
flowers are borne in a terminal raceme,
the anthers open introrsely and the fruit
is a capsule, very rarely, as in <i>Dianella</i>, a
berry. It contains 64 genera. <i>Asphodelus</i>
(asphodel) is a Mediterranean genus;
<i>Simethis</i>, a slender herb with grassy
radical leaves, is a native of west and
southern Europe extending into south Ireland. <i>Anthericum</i>
and <i>Chlorophytum</i>, herbs with radical often grass-like leaves and
scapes bearing a more or less branched inflorescence of small
generally white flowers, are widely spread in the tropics. Other
genera are <i>Funkia</i>, native of China and Japan, cultivated in
the open air in Britain; <i>Hemerocallis</i>, a small genus of central
Europe and temperate Asia&mdash;<i>H. flava</i> is known in gardens as the
day lily; <i>Phormium</i>, a New Zealand genus to which belongs New
Zealand flax, <i>P. tenax</i>, a useful fibre-plant; <i>Kniphofia</i>, South and
East Africa, several species of which are cultivated; and <i>Aloe</i>. A
small group of Australian genera closely approach the order Juncaceae
in having small crowded flowers with a scarious or membranous
perianth; they include <i>Xanthorrhoea</i> (grass-tree or black-boy)
and <i>Kingia</i>, arborescent plants with an erect woody stem
crowned with a tuft of long stiff narrow leaves, from the centre of
which rises a tall dense flower-spike
or a number of stalked
flower-heads; this group has
been included in Juncaceae, from
which it is doubtfully distinguished
only by the absence of
the long twisted stigmas which
characterize the true rushes.</p>

<p><i>Allioideae.</i>&mdash;The plants grow
from a bulb or short rhizome;
the inflorescence is an apparent
umbel formed of several
shortened monochasial cymes
and subtended by a pair of large
bracts. It contains 22 genera,
the largest of which <i>Allium</i> has
about 250 species&mdash;7 are British;
<i>Agapanthus</i> or African lily is a
well-known garden plant; in
<i>Gagea</i>, a genus of small bulbous
herbs found in most parts of
Europe, the inflorescence is reduced
to a few flowers or a
single flower; <i>G. lutea</i> is a local
and rare British plant.</p>

<p><i>Lilioideae.</i>&mdash;Bulbous plants
with a terminal racemose inflorescence;
the anthers open
introrsely and the capsule is
loculicidal. It contains 28
genera, several being represented
in Britain. The typical
genus <i>Lilium</i> and <i>Fritillaria</i> are
widely distributed in the temperate
regions of the northern
hemisphere; <i>F. meleagris</i>, snake&rsquo;s
head, is found in moist meadows
in some of the southern and central
English counties; <i>Tulipa</i>
contains more than 50 species
in Europe and temperate Asia,
and is specially abundant in the
dry districts of central Asia;
<i>Lloydia</i>, a small slender alpine
plant, widely distributed in the
northern hemisphere, occurs on
Snowdon in Wales; <i>Scilla</i> (squill)
is a large genus, chiefly in Europe
and Asia&mdash;<i>S. nutans</i> is the bluebell
or wild hyacinth; <i>Ornithogalum</i>
(Europe, Africa and west
Asia) is closely allied to <i>Scilla</i>&mdash;<i>O.
umbellatum</i>, star of Bethlehem,
is naturalized in Britain;
<i>Hyacinthus</i> and <i>Muscari</i> are
chiefly Mediterranean; <i>M. racemosum</i>,
grape hyacinth, occurs in sandy pastures in the eastern
counties of England. To this group belong a number of tropical
and especially South African genera such as <i>Albuca</i>, <i>Urginea</i>, <i>Drimia</i>,
<i>Lachenalia</i> and others.</p>

<p><i>Dracaenoideae.</i>&mdash;The plants generally have an erect stem with a
crown of leaves which are often leathery; the anthers open introrsely
and the fruit is a berry or capsule. It contains 9 genera,
several of which, such as <i>Yucca</i> (fig. 5), <i>Dracaena</i> and <i>Cordyline</i>
include arborescent species in which the stem increases in thickness
continually by a centrifugal formation of new tissue; an extreme
case is afforded by <i>Dracaena Draco</i>, the dragon-tree of Teneriffe.
<i>Yucca</i> and several allied genera are natives of the dry country of
the southern and western United States and of Central America.
<i>Dracaena</i> and the allied genus <i>Cordyline</i> occur in the warmer regions
of the Old World. There is a close relation between the pollination
of many yuccas and the life of a moth (<i>Pronuba yuccasella</i>); the
flowers are open and scented at night when the female moth becomes
active, first collecting a load of pollen and then depositing her eggs,
generally in a different flower from that which has supplied the
pollen. The eggs are deposited in the ovary-wall, usually just
below an ovule; after each deposition the moth runs to the top
of the pistil and thrusts some pollen into the opening of the stigma.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page684" id="page684"></a>684</span>
Development of larva and seed go on together, a few of the seeds
serving as food for the insect, which when mature eats through the
pericarp and drops to the ground, remaining dormant in its cocoon
until the next season of flowering when it emerges as a moth.</p>

<p><i>Asparagoideae.</i>&mdash;Plants growing from a rhizome; fruit a berry.
<i>Asparagus</i> contains about 100 species in the dryer warmer parts
of the Old World; it has a short creeping rhizome, from which
springs a slender, herbaceous or woody, often very much branched,
erect or climbing stem, the ultimate branches of which are flattened
or needle-like leaf-like structures (<i>cladodes</i>), the true leaves being
reduced to scales or, in the climbers, forming short, hard more or
less recurved spines. <i>Ruscus aculeatus</i> (fig. 6) is butcher&rsquo;s broom, an
evergreen shrub with flattened leaf-like cladodes, native in the
southerly portion of England and Wales; the small flowers are
unisexual and borne on the face of the cladode; the male contains
three stamens, the filaments of which are united to form a short
stout column on which are seated the diverging cells of the anthers;
in the female the ovary is enveloped by a fleshy staminal tube on
which are borne three barren anthers. <i>Polygonatum</i> and <i>Maianthemum</i>
are allied genera with a herbaceous leafy stem and, in the
former axillary flowers, in the latter flowers in a terminal raceme;
both occur rarely in woods in Britain; <i>P. multiflorum</i> is the well-known
Solomon&rsquo;s seal of gardens (fig. 7), so called from the seal-like
scars on the rhizome of stems of previous seasons, the hanging
flowers of which
contain no honey,
but are visited by
bees for the pollen.
<i>Convallaria</i> is lily
of the valley; <i>Aspidistra</i>,
native of the
Himalayas, China
and Japan, is a
well-known pot
plant; its flowers
depart from the
normal arrangement
of the order
in having the parts
in fours (tetramerous).
Paris, including
the British
Herb <i>Paris</i> (<i>P.
quadrifolia</i>), has
solitary tetra- to
poly-merous flowers
terminating the short annual shoot which bears a whorl of four or
more leaves below the flower; in this and in some species of the
nearly allied genus <i>Trillium</i> (chiefly temperate North America)
the flowers have a fetid smell, which together with the dark purple
of the ovary and stigmas and frequently also of the stamens and
petals, attracts carrion-loving flies, which alight on the stigma and
then climb the anthers and become dusted with pollen; the pollen
is then carried to the stigmas of another flower.</p>

<p><i>Luzuriagoideae</i> are shrubs or undershrubs with erect or climbing
branches and fruit a berry. <i>Lapageria</i>, a native of Chile, is a favourite
greenhouse climber with fine bell-shaped flowers.</p>

<p><i>Smilacoideae</i> are climbing shrubs with broad net-veined leaves
and small dioecious flowers in umbels springing from the leaf-axils;
the fruit is a berry. They climb by means of tendrils, which are
stipular structures arising from the leaf-sheath. <i>Smilax</i> is a characteristic
tropical genus containing about 200 species; the dried
roots of some species are the drug sarsaparilla.</p>

<p>The two tribes <i>Ophiopogonoideae</i> and <i>Aletroideae</i> are often included
in a distinct order, Haemodoraceae. The plants have a short
rhizome and narrow or lanceolate basal leaves; and they are
characterized by the ovary being often half-inferior. They contain
a few genera chiefly old world tropical and subtropical. The leaves
of species of <i>Sansevieria</i> yield a valuable fibre.</p>
</div>

<p>Liliaceae may be regarded as the typical order of the series
Liliiflorae. It resembles Juncaceae in the general plan of the
flower, which, however, has become much more elaborate and
varied in the form and colour of its perianth in association with
transmission of pollen by insect agency; a link between the
two orders is found in the group of Australian genera referred
to above under Asphodeloideae. The tribe Ophiopogonoideae,
with its tendency to an inferior ovary, suggests an affinity with
the Amaryllidaceae which resemble Liliaceae in habit and in the
horizontal plan of the flower, but have an inferior ovary. The
tribe Smilacoideae, shrubby climbers with net-veined leaves and
small unisexual flowers, bears much the same relationship to
the order as a whole as does the order Dioscoreaceae, which
have a similar habit, but flowers with an inferior ovary, to the
Amaryllidaceae.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILIENCRON, DETLEV VON<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1844-1909), German poet and
novelist, was born at Kiel on the 3rd of June 1844. He entered
the army and took part in the campaigns of 1866 and 1870-71,
in both of which he was wounded. He retired with the rank
of captain and spent some time in America, afterwards settling
at Kellinghusen in Holstein, where he remained till 1887. After
some time at Munich, he settled in Altona and then at Altrahistedt,
near Hamburg. He died in July 1909. He first attracted
attention by the volume of poems, <i>Adjutantenritte und andere
Gedichte</i> (1883), which was followed by several unsuccessful
dramas, a volume of short stories, <i>Eine Sommerschlacht</i> (1886),
and a novel <i>Breide Hummelsbüttel</i> (1887). Other collections of
short stories appeared under the titles <i>Unter flatternden Fahnen</i>
(1888). <i>Der Mäcen</i> (1889), <i>Krieg und Frieden</i> (1891); of lyric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page685" id="page685"></a>685</span>
poetry in 1889, 1890 (<i>Der Heidegänger und andere Gedichte</i>), 1893,
and 1903 (<i>Bunte Beute</i>). Interesting, too, is the humorous epic
<i>Poggfred</i> (1896; 2nd ed. 1904). Liliencron is one of the most
eminent of recent German lyric poets; his <i>Adjutantenritte</i>,
with its fresh original note, broke with the well-worn literary
conventions which had been handed down from the middle of
the century. Liliencron&rsquo;s work is, however, somewhat unequal,
and he lacks the sustained power which makes the successful
prose writer.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Liliencron&rsquo;s <i>Sämtliche Werke</i> have been published in 14 vols.
(1904-1905); his <i>Gedichte</i> having been previously collected in four
volumes under the titles <i>Kampf und Spiele, Kämpfe und Ziele,
Nebel und Sonne</i> and <i>Bunte Beute</i> (1897-1903). See O. J. Bierbaum,
<i>D. von Liliencron</i> (1892); H. Greinz, <i>Liliencron, eine literarhistorische

a female demon of Jewish folk-lore, equivalent to the English
vampire. The personality and name are derived from a Babylonian-Assyrian
demon Lilit or Lilu. Lilith was believed to
have a special power for evil over children. The superstition
was extended to a cult surviving among some Jews even as late
as the 7th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> In the Rabbinical literature Lilith

<p><span class="bold">LILLE<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span>, a city of northern France, capital of the department
of Nord, 154 m. N. by E. of Paris on the Northern railway.
Pop. (1906) 196,624. Lille is situated in a low fertile plain on
the right bank of the Deûle in a rich agricultural and industrial
region of which it is the centre. It is a first-class fortress and
headquarters of the I. army corps, and has an enceinte and a
pentagonal citadel, one of Vauban&rsquo;s finest works, situated to
the west of the town, from which it is divided by the Deûle.
The modern fortifications comprise over twenty detached forts
and batteries, the perimeter of the defences being about 20 m.
Before 1858 the town, fortified by Vauban about 1668, occupied
an elliptical area of about 2500 yds. by 1300, with the church
of Notre-Dame de la Treille in the centre, but the ramparts on
the south side have been demolished and the ditches filled up,
their place being now occupied by the great Boulevard de la
Liberté, which extends in a straight line from the goods station
of the railway to the citadel. At the S.E. end of this boulevard
are grouped the majority of the numerous educational establishments
of the city. The new enceinte encloses the old communes
of Esquermes, Wazemmes and Moulins-Lille, the area of the town
being thus more than doubled. In the new quarters fine boulevards
and handsome squares, such as the Place de la République,
have been laid out in pleasant contrast with the sombre aspect
of the old town. The district of St André to the north, the only
elegant part of the old town, is the residence of the aristocracy.
Outside the enceinte populous suburbs surround the city on
every side. The demolition of the fortifications on the north and
east of the city, which is continued in those directions by the
great suburbs of La Madeleine, St Maurice and Fives, must
accelerate its expansion towards Roubaix and Tourcoing. At
the demolition of the southern fortifications, the Paris gate, a
triumphal arch erected in 1682 in honour of Louis XIV., after
the conquest of Flanders, was preserved. On the east the
Ghent and Roubaix gates, built in the Renaissance style, with
bricks of different colours, date from 1617 and 1622, the time
of the Spanish domination. On the same side the Noble-Tour
is a relic of the medieval ramparts. The present enceinte is
pierced by numerous gates, including water gates for the canal
of the Deûle and for the Arbonnoise, which extends into a marsh
in the south-west corner of the town. The citadel, which contains
the barracks and arsenal, is surrounded by public gardens.
The more interesting buildings are in the old town, where, in
the Grande Place and Rue Faidherbe, its animation is concentrated.
St Maurice, a church in the late Gothic style, dates
in its oldest portions from the 15th century, and was restored
in 1872; Ste Cathérine belongs to the 15th, 16th and 18th
centuries, St André to the first years of the 18th century, and
Ste Madeleine to the last half of the 17th century; all possess
valuable pictures, but St Maurice alone, with nave and double
aisles, and elegant modern spire, is architecturally notable.
Notre-Dame de la Treille, begun in 1855, in the style of the 15th
century, possesses an ancient statue of the Virgin which is the
object of a well-known pilgrimage. Of the civil buildings the
Bourse (17th century) built round a courtyard in which stands
a bronze statue of Napoleon I., the Hôtel d&rsquo;Aigremont, the
Hôtel Gentil and other houses are in the Flemish style; the
Hôtel de Ville, dating in the main from the middle of the 19th
century, preserves a portion of a palace built by Philip the Good,
duke of Burgundy, in the 15th century. The prefecture, the
Palais des Beaux-Arts, the law-courts, the school of arts and
crafts, and the Lycée Faidherbe are imposing modern buildings.
In the middle of the Grande Place stands a column, erected in
1848, commemorating the defence of the town in 1792 (see below),
and there are also statues to Generals L. L. C. Faidherbe and
F. O. de Négrier, and busts of Louis Pasteur and the popular
poet and singer A. Desrousseaux. The Palais des Beaux-Arts
contains a museum and picture galleries, among the richest in
France, as well as a unique collection of original designs of the
great masters bequeathed to Lille by J. B. Wicar, and including a
celebrated wax model of a girl&rsquo;s head usually attributed to some
Italian artist of the 16th century. The city also possesses a
commercial and colonial museum, an industrial museum, a fine
collection of departmental and municipal archives, the museum
of the Institute of Natural Sciences and a library containing
many valuable manuscripts, housed at the Hôtel de Ville. The
large military hospital, once a Jesuit college, is one of several
similar institutions.</p>

<p>Lille is the seat of a prefect and has tribunals of first instance
and of commerce, a board of trade arbitrators, a chamber of
commerce and a branch of the Bank of France. It is the centre
of an académie (educational division) and has a university with
faculties of laws, letters, science and medicine and pharmacy,
together with a Catholic institute comprising faculties of theology,
law, medicine and pharmacy, letters, science, a technical school,
and a department of social and political science. Secondary
education is given at the Lycée Faidherbe, and the Lycée
Fénelon (for girls), a higher school of commerce, a national
technical school and other establishments; to these must be
added schools of music and fine arts, and the Industrial and
Pasteur Institutes.</p>

<p>The industries, which are carried on in the new quarters of
the town and in the suburbs, are of great variety and importance.
In the first rank comes the spinning of flax and the weaving of
cloth, table-linen, damask, ticking and flax velvet. The spinning
of flax thread for sewing and lace-making is specially connected
with Lille. The manufacture of woollen fabrics and cotton-spinning
and the making of cotton-twist of fine quality are also
carried on. There are important printing establishments, state
factories for the manufacture of tobacco and the refining of
saltpetre and very numerous breweries, while chemical, oil,
white lead and sugar-works, distilleries, bleaching-grounds,
dye-works, machinery and boiler works and cabinet-making
occupy many thousands of workmen. Plant for sugar-works
and distilleries, military stores, steam-engines, locomotives,
and bridges of all kinds are produced by the company of Fives-Lille.
Lille is one of the most important junctions of the Northern
railway, and the Deûle canal affords communication with neighbouring
ports and with Belgium. Trade is chiefly in the raw
material and machinery for its industries, in the products thereof,
and in the wheat and other agricultural products of the surrounding
district.</p>

<p>Lille (l&rsquo;Île) is said to date its origin from the time of Count
Baldwin IV. of Flanders, who in 1030 surrounded with walls a
little town which had arisen around the castle of Buc. In the
first half of the 13th century, the town, which had developed
rapidly, obtained communal privileges. Destroyed by Philip
Augustus in 1213, it was rebuilt by Joanna of Constantinople,
countess of Flanders, but besieged and retaken by Philip the
Fair in 1297. After having taken part with the Flemings against
the king of France, it was ceded to the latter in 1312. In 1369
Charles V., king of France, gave it to Louis de Male, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page686" id="page686"></a>686</span>
transmitted his rights to his daughter Margaret, wife of Philip
the Bold, duke of Burgundy. Under the Burgundian rule Lille
enjoyed great prosperity; its merchants were at the head of the
London Hansa. Philip the Good made it his residence, and
within its walls held the first chapters of the order of the Golden
Fleece. With the rest of Flanders it passed from the dukes of
Burgundy to Austria and then to Spain. After the death of
Philip IV. of Spain, Louis XIV. reclaimed the territory
and besieged Lille in 1667. He forced it to capitulate, but
preserved all its laws, customs, privileges and liberties. In 1708,
after an heroic resistance, it surrendered to Prince Eugène and
the duke of Marlborough. The treaty of Utrecht restored it
to France. In 1792 the Austrians bombarded it for nine days
and nights without intermission, but had ultimately to raise
the siege.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILLEBONNE,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> a town of France in the department of Seine-Inférieure,
3½ m. N. of the Seine and 24 m. E. of Havre by the
Western railway. Pop. (1906) 5370. It lies in the valley of
the Bolbec at the foot of wooded hills. The church of Notre-Dame,
partly modern, preserves a Gothic portal of the 16th
century and a graceful tower of the same period. The park
contains a fine cylindrical donjon and other remains of a castle
founded by William the Conqueror and rebuilt in the 13th century.
The principal industries are cotton-spinning and the manufacture
of calico and candles.</p>

<p>Lillebonne under the Romans, <i>Juliobona</i>, was the capital of
the Caletes, or inhabitants of the Pays de Caux, in the time of
Caesar, by whom it was destroyed. It was afterwards rebuilt
by Augustus, and before it was again ruined by the barbarian
invasions it had become an important centre whence Roman
roads branched out in all directions. The remains of ancient
baths and of a theatre capable of holding 3000 persons have
been brought to light. Many Roman and Gallic relics, notably a
bronze statue of a woman and two fine mosaics, have been found
and transported to the museum at Rouen. In the middle ages
the fortifications of the town were constructed out of materials
supplied by the theatre. The town recovered some of its old
importance under William the Conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILLIBULLERO,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lilliburlero</span>, the name of a song popular
at the end of the 17th century, especially among the army and
supporters of William III. in the war in Ireland during the
revolution of 1688. The tune appears to have been much older,
and was sung to an Irish nursery song at the beginning of the
17th century, and the attribution of Henry Purcell is based on
the very slight ground that it was published in <i>Music&rsquo;s Handmaid</i>,
1689, as &ldquo;A new Irish Tune&rdquo; by Henry Purcell. It was also a
marching tune familiar to soldiers. The doggerel verses have
generally been assigned to Thomas Wharton, and deal with the
administration of Talbot, earl of Tyrconnel, appointed by James
as his lieutenant in Ireland in 1687. The refrain of the song
<i>lilliburllero bullen a la</i> gave the title of the song. Macaulay says
of the song &ldquo;The verses and the tune caught the fancy of the
nation. From one end of England to the other all classes were
singing this idle rhyme.&rdquo; Though Wharton claimed he had
&ldquo;sung a king out of three kingdoms&rdquo; and Burnet says &ldquo;perhaps
never had so slight a thing so great an effect&rdquo; the success of
the song was &ldquo;the effect, and not the cause of that excited state
of public feeling which produced the revolution&rdquo; (Macaulay,
<i>Hist. of Eng.</i> chap. ix.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILLO, GEORGE<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (1693-1739), English dramatist, son of a
Dutch jeweller, was born in London on the 4th of February
1693. He was brought up to his father&rsquo;s trade and was for
many years a partner in the business. His first piece, <i>Silvia,
or the Country Burial</i>, was a ballad opera produced at Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn Fields in November 1730. On the 22nd of June 1731
his domestic tragedy, <i>The Merchant</i>, renamed later <i>The London
Merchant, or the History of George Barnwell</i>, was produced by
Theophilus Cibber and his company at Drury Lane. The piece
is written in prose, which is not free from passages which are
really blank verse, and is founded on &ldquo;An excellent ballad of
George Barnwell, an apprentice of London who ... thrice
robbed his master, and murdered his uncle in Ludlow.&rdquo; In
breaking through the tradition that the characters of every
tragedy must necessarily be drawn from people of high rank and
fortune he went back to the Elizabethan domestic drama of
passion of which the <i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i> is a type. The obtrusively
moral purpose of this play places it in the same literary category
as the novels of Richardson. Scoffing critics called it, with
reason, a &ldquo;Newgate tragedy,&rdquo; but it proved extremely popular
on the stage. It was regularly acted for many years at holiday
seasons for the moral benefit of the apprentices. The last act
contained a scene, generally omitted on the London stage, in
which the gallows actually figured. In 1734 Lillo celebrated
the marriage of the Princess Anne with William IV. of Orange
in <i>Britannia and Batavia</i>, a masque. A second tragedy, <i>The
Christian Hero</i>, was produced at Drury Lane on the 13th of
January 1735. It is based on the story of Scanderbeg, the
Albanian chieftain, a life of whom is printed with the play.
Thomas Whincop (d. 1730) wrote a piece on the same subject,
printed posthumously in 1747. Both Lillo and William Havard,
who also wrote a dramatic version of the story, were accused
of plagiarizing Whincop&rsquo;s <i>Scanderbeg</i>. Another murder-drama,
<i>Fatal Curiosity</i>, in which an old couple murder an unknown
guest, who proves to be their own son, was based on a tragedy
at Bohelland Farm near Penryn in 1618. It was produced by
Henry Fielding at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in 1736,
but with small success. In the next year Fielding tacked it on
to his own <i>Historical Register for 1736</i>, and it was received more
kindly. It was revised by George Colman the elder in 1782, by
Henry Mackenzie in 1784, &amp;c. Lillo also wrote an adaptation
of the Shakespearean play of <i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i>, with the
title <i>Marina</i> (Covent Garden, August 1st, 1738); and a tragedy,
<i>Elmerick, or Justice Triumphant</i> (produced posthumously,
Drury Lane, February 23rd, 1740). The statement made in the
prologue to this play that Lillo died in poverty seems unfounded.
His death took place on the 3rd of September 1739. He left
an unfinished version of <i>Arden of Feversham</i>, which was completed
by Dr John Hoadly and produced in 1759. Lillo&rsquo;s
reputation proved short-lived. He has nevertheless a certain
cosmopolitan importance, for the influence of <i>George Barnwell</i>
can be traced in the sentimental drama of both France and
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILLY, WILLIAM<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1602-1681), English astrologer, was born
in 1602 at Diseworth in Leicestershire, his family having been
settled as yeomen in the place for &ldquo;many ages.&rdquo; He received
a tolerably good classical education at the school of Ashby-de-la-Zouche,
but he naïvely tells us what may perhaps have some
significance in reference to his after career, that his master
&ldquo;never taught logic.&rdquo; In his eighteenth year, his father having
fallen into great poverty, he went to London and was employed
in attendance on an old citizen and his wife. His master, at his
death in 1627, left him an annuity of £20; and, Lilly having soon
afterwards married the widow, she, dying in 1633, left him property
to the value of about £1000. He now began to dabble in astrology,
reading all the books on the subject he could fall in with, and
occasionally trying his hand at unravelling mysteries by means
of his art. The years 1642 and 1643 were devoted to a careful
revision of all his previous reading, and in particular having
lighted on Valentine Naibod&rsquo;s <i>Commentary on Alchabitius</i>, he
&ldquo;seriously studied him and found him to be the profoundest
author he ever met with.&rdquo; About the same time he tells us
that he &ldquo;did carefully take notice of every grand action betwixt
king and parliament, and did first then incline to believe that as
all sublunary affairs depend on superior causes, so there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page687" id="page687"></a>687</span>
possibility of discovering them by the configurations of the
superior bodies.&rdquo; And, having thereupon &ldquo;made some essays,&rdquo;
he &ldquo;found encouragement to proceed further, and ultimately
framed to himself that method which he ever afterwards followed.&rdquo;
He then began to issue his prophetical almanacs and other works,
which met with serious attention from some of the most prominent
members of the Long Parliament. If we may believe himself,
Lilly lived on friendly and almost intimate terms with Bulstrode
Whitlock, Lenthall the speaker, Sir Philip Stapleton, Elias
Ashmole and others. Even Selden seems to have given him
some countenance, and probably the chief difference between
him and the mass of the community at the time was that, while
others believed in the general truth of astrology, he ventured
to specify the future events to which its calculations pointed.
Even from his own account of himself, however, it is evident
that he did not trust implicitly to the indications given by the
aspects of the heavens, but like more vulgar fortune-tellers
kept his eyes and ears open for any information which might
make his predictions safe. It appears that he had correspondents
both at home and in foreign parts to keep him conversant with
the probable current of affairs. Not a few of his exploits indicate
rather the quality of a clever police detective than of a profound
astrologer. After the Restoration he very quickly fell into disrepute.
His sympathy with the parliament, which his predictions
had generally shown, was not calculated to bring him into royal
favour. He came under the lash of Butler, who, making allowance
for some satiric exaggeration, has given in the character
of Sidrophel a probably not very incorrect picture of the man;
and, having by this time amassed a tolerable fortune, he bought
a small estate at Hersham in Surrey, to which he retired, and
where he diverted the exercise of his peculiar talents to the
practice of medicine. He died in 1681.</p>

<p>Lilly&rsquo;s life of himself, published after his death, is still worth

<p><span class="bold">LILY,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> <i>Lilium</i>, the typical genus of the botanical order
Liliaceae, embracing nearly eighty species, all confined to the
northern hemisphere, and widely distributed throughout the
north temperate zone. The earliest in cultivation were described
in 1597 by Gerard (<i>Herball</i>, p. 146), who figures eight kinds of
true lilies, which include <i>L. album</i> (<i>L. candidum</i>) and a variety,
<i>bizantinum</i>, two umbellate forms of the type <i>L. bulbiferum</i>,
named <i>L. aureum</i> and <i>L. cruentum latifolium</i>, and three with
pendulous flowers, apparently forms of the martagon lily.
Parkinson, in his <i>Paradisus</i> (1629), described five varieties of
martagon, six of umbellate kinds&mdash;two white ones, and <i>L.
pomponium</i>, <i>L. chalcedonicum</i>, <i>L. carniolicum</i> and <i>L. pyrenaicum</i>&mdash;together
with one American, <i>L. canadense</i>, which had been
introduced in 1629. For the ancient and medieval history of
the lily, see M. de Cannart d&rsquo;Hamale&rsquo;s <i>Monographie historique
et littéraire des lis</i> (Malines, 1870). Since that period many new
species have been added. The latest authorities for description
and classification of the genus are J. G. Baker (&ldquo;Revision of the
Genera and Species of Tulipeae,&rdquo; <i>Journ. of Linn. Soc.</i> xiv. p.
211, 1874), and J. H. Elwes (<i>Monograph of the Genus</i> Lilium,
1880), who first tested all the species under cultivation, and has
published every one beautifully figured by W. H. Fitch, and
some hybrids. With respect to the production of hybrids, the
genus is remarkable for its power of resisting the influence of
foreign pollen, for the seedlings of any species, when crossed,
generally resemble that which bears them. A good account
of the new species and principal varieties discovered since 1880,
with much information on the cultivation of lilies and the
diseases to which they are subject, will be found in the report
of the Conference on Lilies, in the <i>Journal of the Royal Horticultural
Society</i>, 1901. The new species include a number discovered
in central and western China by Dr Augustine Henry
and other collectors; also several from Japan and California.</p>

<p>The structure of the flower represents the simple type of monocotyledons,
consisting of two whorls of petals, of three free
parts each, six free stamens, and a consolidated pistil of three
carpels, ripening into a three-valved capsule containing many
winged seeds. In form, the flower assumes three types:
trumpet-shaped, with a more or less elongated tube, <i>e.g.</i> <i>L.
longiflorum</i> and <i>L. candidum</i>; an open form with spreading
perianth leaves, <i>e.g.</i> <i>L. auratum</i>; or assuming a pendulous
habit, with the tips strongly reflexed, <i>e.g.</i> the martagon type.
All have scaly bulbs, which in three west American species,
as <i>L. Humboldti</i>, are remarkable for being somewhat intermediate
between a bulb and a creeping rhizome. <i>L. bulbiferum</i> and its
allies produce aerial reproductive bulbils in the axils of the leaves.
The bulbs of several species are eaten, such as of <i>L. avenaceum</i>
in Kamchatka, of <i>L. Martagon</i> by the Cossacks, and of <i>L.
tigrinum</i>, the &ldquo;tiger lily,&rdquo; in China and Japan. Medicinal uses
were ascribed to the species, but none appear to have any marked
properties in this respect.</p>

<p>The white lily, <i>L. candidum</i>, the <span class="grk" title="leirion">&#955;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> of the Greeks, was one
of the commonest garden flowers of antiquity, appearing in the poets
from Homer downwards side by side with the rose and the violet.
According to Hehn, roses and lilies entered Greece from the east by
way of Phrygia, Thrace and
Macedonia (<i>Kulturpflanzen
und Hausthiere</i>, 3rd ed.,
p. 217). The word <span class="grk" title="leirion">&#955;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>
itself, from which <i>lilium</i> is
derived by assimilation of
consonants, appears to be
Eranian (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 527), and
according to ancient etymologists
(Lagarde, <i>Ges.
Abh.</i> p. 227) the town of
Susa was connected with the
Persian name of the lily
<i>sûsan</i> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="souson">&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span>, Heb.
<i>shôshan</i>). Mythologically the
white lily, <i>Rosa Junonis</i>, was
fabled to have sprung from
the milk of Hera. As the
plant of purity it was contrasted
with the rose of
Aphrodite. The word <span class="grk" title="krinon">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>,
on the other hand, included
red and purple lilies, Plin.
<i>H.N.</i> xxi. 5 (11, 12), the
red lily being best known in
Syria and Judaea (Phaselis).
This perhaps is the &ldquo;red
lily of Constantinople&rdquo; of
Gerard, <i>L. chalcedonicum</i>.
The lily of the Old Testament
(shôshan) may be conjectured
to be a red lily from
the simile in Cant. v. 13, unless the allusion is to the fragrance rather
than the colour of the lips, in which case the white lily must be
thought of. The &ldquo;lilies of the field,&rdquo; Matt. vi. 28, are <span class="grk" title="krina">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#945;</span>, and the
comparison of their beauty with royal robes suggests their identification
with the red Syrian lily of Pliny. Lilies, however, are not a
conspicuous feature in the flora of Palestine, and the red anemone
(<i>Anemone coronaria</i>), with which all the hill-sides of Galilee are
dotted in the spring, is perhaps more likely to have suggested the
figure. For the lily in the pharmacopoeia of the ancients see Adams&rsquo;s
<i>Paul. Aegineta</i>, iii. 196. It was used in unguents and against the
bites of snakes, &amp;c. In the middle ages the flower continued to be
common and was taken as the symbol of heavenly purity. The
three golden lilies of France are said to have been originally three
lance-heads.</p>

<p>Lily of the valley, <i>Convallaria majalis</i>, belongs to a different tribe
(<i>Asparagoideae</i>) of the same order. It grows wild in woods in some
parts of England, and in Europe, northern Asia and the Alleghany
Mountains of North America. The leaves and flower-scapes spring
from an underground creeping stem. The small pendulous bell-shaped
flowers contain no honey but are visited by bees for the
pollen.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;lily&rdquo; is loosely used in connexion with many plants
which are not really liliums at all, but belong to genera which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page688" id="page688"></a>688</span>
quite distinct botanically. Thus, the Lent lily is <i>Narcissus Pseudo-narcissus</i>;
the African lily is <i>Agapanthus umbellatus</i>; the Belladonna
lily is <i>Amaryllis Belladonna</i> (<i>q.v.</i>); the Jacobaea lily is <i>Sprekelia
formosissima</i>; the Mariposa lily is <i>Calochortus</i>; the lily of the Incas
is <i>Alstroemeria pelegrina</i>; St Bernard&rsquo;s lily is <i>Anthericum Liliago</i>;
St Bruno&rsquo;s lily is <i>Anthericum</i> (or <i>Paradisia</i>) <i>Liliastrum</i>; the water
lily is <i>Nymphaea alba</i>; the Arum lily is <i>Richardia africana</i>; and
there are many others.</p>

<p>The true lilies are so numerous and varied that no general cultural
instructions will be alike suitable to all. Some species, as <i>L.
Martagon</i>, <i>candidum</i>, <i>chalcedonicum</i>, <i>Szovitzianum</i> (or <i>colchicum</i>),
<i>bulbiferum</i>, <i>croceum</i>, <i>Henryi</i>, <i>pomponium</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;Turk&rsquo;s cap lily,&rdquo;
and others, will grow in almost any good garden soil, and succeed
admirably in loam of a rather heavy character, and dislike too
much peat. But a compost of peat, loam and leaf-soil suits <i>L.
auratum</i>, <i>Brownii</i>, <i>concolor</i>, <i>elegans</i>, <i>giganteum</i>, <i>japonicum</i>, <i>longiflorum</i>,
<i>monadelphum</i>, <i>pardalinum</i>, <i>speciosum</i>, and the tiger lily
(<i>L. tigrinum</i>) well, and a larger proportion of peat is indispensable
for the beautiful American <i>L. superbum</i> and <i>canadense</i>. The margin
of rhododendron beds, where there are sheltered recesses amongst
the plants, suits many of the more delicate species well, partial shade
and shelter of some kind being essential. The bulbs should be
planted from 6 to 10 in. (according to size) below the surface, which
should at once be mulched over with half-decayed leaves or coconut
fibre to keep out frost.</p>

<p>The noble <i>L. auratum</i>, with its large white flowers, having a
yellow band and numerous red or purple spots, is a magnificent
plant when grown to perfection; and so are the varieties called
<i>rubro-vittatum</i> and <i>cruentum</i>, which have the central band crimson
instead of yellow; and the broad-petalled <i>platyphyllum</i>, and its
almost pure white sub-variety called <i>virginale</i>. Of <i>L. speciosum</i>
(well known to most gardeners as <i>lancifolium</i>), the true typical form
and the red-spotted and white varieties are grand plants for late
summer blooming in the conservatory. The tiger lily, <i>L. tigrinum</i>,
and its varieties <i>Fortunei</i>, <i>splendidum</i> and <i>flore-pleno</i>, are amongst
the best species for the flower garden; <i>L. Thunbergianum</i> and its
many varieties being also good border flowers. The pretty <i>L.
Leichtlinii</i> and <i>L. colchicum</i> (or <i>Szovitsianum</i>) with drooping yellow
flowers and the scarlet drooping-flowered <i>L. tenuifolium</i> make up,
with those already mentioned, a series of the finest hardy flowers of
the summer garden. The Indian <i>L. giganteum</i> is perfectly distinct
in character, having broad heart-shaped leaves, and a noble stem
10 to 14 ft. high, bearing a dozen or more large deflexed, funnel-shaped,
white, purple-stained flowers; <i>L. cordifolium</i> (China and
Japan) is similar in character, but dwarfer in habit.</p>

<p>For pot culture, the soil should consist of three parts turfy loam
to one of leaf-mould and thoroughly rotted manure, adding enough
pure grit to keep the compost porous. If leaf-mould is not at hand,
turfy peat may be substituted for it. The plants should be potted in
October. The pots should be plunged in a cold frame and protected
from frost, and about May may be removed to a sheltered and
moderately shady place out-doors to remain till they flower, when
they may be removed to the greenhouse. This treatment suits the
gorgeous <i>L. auratum</i>, the splendid varieties of <i>L. speciosum</i> (<i>lancifolium</i>)
and also the chaste-flowering trumpet-tubed <i>L. longiflorum</i>
and its varieties. Thousands of bulbs of such lilies as <i>longiflorum</i>
and <i>speciosum</i> are now retarded in refrigerators and taken out in
batches for greenhouse work as required.</p>

<p><i>Diseases.</i>&mdash;Lilies are, under certain conditions favourable to the
development of the disease, liable to the attacks of three parasitic
fungi. The most destructive is <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> which forms orange-brown
or buff specks on the stems, pedicels, leaves and flower-buds,
which increase in size and become covered with a delicate grey
mould, completely destroying or disfiguring the parts attacked.
The spores formed on the delicate grey mould are carried during
the summer from one plant to another, thus spreading the disease,
and also germinate in the soil where the fungus may remain passive
during the winter producing a new crop of spores next spring, or
sometimes attacking the scales of the bulbs forming small black
hard bodies embedded in the flesh. For prevention, the surface
soil covering bulbs should be removed every autumn and replaced by
soil mixed with kainit; manure for mulching should also be mixed
with kainit, which acts as a steriliser. If the fungus appears on the
foliage spray with potassium sulphide solution (2 oz. in 3 gallons
of water). <i>Uromyces Erythronii</i>, a rust, sometimes causes considerable
injury to the foliage of species of <i>Lilium</i> and other bulbous
plants, forming large discoloured blotches on the leaves. The
diseased stems should be removed and burned before the leaves
fall; as the bulb is not attacked the plant will start growth next
season free from disease. <i>Rhizopus necans</i> is sometimes the cause of
extensive destruction of bulbs. The fungus attacks injured roots
and afterwards passes into the bulb which becomes brown and
finally rots. The fungus hibernates in the soil and enters through
broken or injured roots, hence care should be taken when removing
the bulbs that the roots are injured as little as possible. An excellent
packing material for dormant buds is coarsely crushed wood-charcoal
to which has been added a sprinkling of flowers of sulphur.
This prevents infection from outside and also destroys any spores
or fungus mycelium that may have been packed away along with
the bulbs.</p>

<p>When cultivated in greenhouses liliums are subject to attack
from aphides (green fly) in the early stages of growth. These pests
can be kept in check by syringing with nicotine, soft-soap and
quassia solutions, or by &ldquo;vaporising&rdquo; two or three evenings in
succession, afterwards syringing the plants with clear tepid water.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LILYE,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lily</span>, <span class="bold">WILLIAM</span> (<i>c.</i> 1468-1522), English scholar,
was born at Odiham in Hampshire. He entered the university
of Oxford in 1486, and after graduating in arts went on a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem. On his return he put in at Rhodes, which
was still occupied by the knights of St John, under whose protection
many Greeks had taken refuge after the capture of Constantinople
by the Turks. He then went on to Italy, where he
attended the lectures of Sulpitius Verulanus and Pomponius
Laetus at Rome, and of Egnatius at Venice. After his return
he settled in London (where he became intimate with Thomas
More) as a private teacher of grammar, and is believed to have
been the first who taught Greek in that city. In 1510 Colet,
dean of St Paul&rsquo;s, who was then founding the school which
afterwards became famous, appointed Lilye the first high master.
He died of the plague on the 25th of February 1522.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lilye is famous not only as one of the pioneers of Greek learning,
but as one of the joint-authors of a book, familiar to many generations
of students during the 19th century, the old Eton Latin grammar.
The <i>Brevissima Institutio</i>, a sketch by Colet, corrected by Erasmus
and worked upon by Lilye, contains two portions, the author of
which is indisputably Lilye. These are the lines on the genders of
nouns, beginning <i>Propria quae maribus</i>, and those on the conjugation
of verbs beginning <i>As in praesenti</i>. The <i>Carmen de Moribus</i> bears
Lilye&rsquo;s name in the early editions; but Hearne asserts that it was
written by Leland, who was one of his scholars, and that Lilye only
adapted it. Besides the <i>Brevissima Institutio</i>, Lilye wrote a variety
of Latin pieces both in prose and Verse. Some of the latter are
printed along with the Latin verses of Sir Thomas More in <i>Progymnasmata
Thomae Mori et Gulielmi Lylii Sodalium</i> (1518). Another
volume of Latin verse (<i>Antibossicon ad Gulielmum Hormannum</i>,
1521) is directed against a rival schoolmaster and grammarian,
Robert Whittington, who had &ldquo;under the feigned name of Bossus,
much provoked Lilye with scoffs and biting verses.&rdquo;</p>

lives of the learned men of Great Britain; and the article by J. H.

<p><span class="bold">LIMA,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Allen county, Ohio,
U.S.A., on the Ottawa river, about 70 m. S.S.W. of Toledo,
Pop. (1890) 15,981; (1900) 21,723, of whom 1457 were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page689" id="page689"></a>689</span>
foreign-born and 731 were negroes; (1910 census) 30,508. It is
served by the Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne &amp; Chicago
division), the Erie, the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton, the Lake
Erie &amp; Western, the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton railways, and by
six interurban electric lines. Immediately N. of the city is a
state asylum for the insane. Lima has a Carnegie library, a
city hospital and a public park of 100 acres. Among the principal
buildings are the county court house, a masonic temple, an
Elks&rsquo; home and a soldiers&rsquo; and sailors&rsquo; memorial building.
Lima College was conducted here from 1893 to 1908. Lima is
situated in the centre of the great north-western oil-field (Trenton
limestone of the Ordovician system) of Ohio, which was first
developed in 1885; the product of the Lima district was
20,575,138 barrels in 1896, 15,877,730 barrels in 1902 and
6,748,676 barrels in 1908. The city is a headquarters of the
Standard Oil Company, and the refining of petroleum is one of
the principal industries. The total value of the factory product in
1905 was $8,155,586, an increase of 31.1% over that in 1900.
Lima contains railway shops of the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp;
Dayton and the Lake Erie &amp; Western railways. The city has
a large wholesale and jobbing trade. The municipality owns and
operates the water-works. Lima was laid out in 1831, and
was first organized as a city under a general state law in 1842.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMA,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> a coast department of central Peru, bounded N. by
Ancachs, E. by Junin and Huancavelica, S. by Ica and W.
by the Pacific Ocean. Pop. (1906 estimate) 250,000; area
13,314 sq. m. The eastern boundary follows the crests of the
Western Cordillera, which gives to the department the western
slopes of this chain with the drainage basins of the rivers Huaura,
Chancay, Chillon, Rimac, Lurin, Mala and Cañete. Although
the department forms part of the rainless region, these rivers,
fed from the snows of the high Andes, provide water for the
irrigation of large areas devoted to the raising of cotton, sugar,
sorghum, Indian corn, alfalfa, potatoes, grapes and olives. The
sugar estates of the Cañete are among the best in Peru and are
served by a narrow gauge railway terminating at the small
port of Cerro Azul. Indian corn is grown in Chancay and other
northern valleys, and is chiefly used, together with alfalfa and
barley, in fattening swine for lard. The mineral resources are
not important, though gold washings in the Cañete valley have
been worked since early colonial times. One of the most important
industrial establishments in the republic is the smelting
works at Casapalca, on the Oroya railway, in the Rimac valley,
which receives ores from neighbouring mines of the district of
Huarochiri. The department is crossed from S.W. to N.E. by
the Oroya railway, and several short lines run from the city of
Lima to neighbouring towns. Besides Lima (<i>q.v.</i>) the principal
towns are Huacho, Cañete (port), Canta, Yauyos, Chorrillos,
Miraflores and Barranco&mdash;the last three being summer resorts
for the people of the capital, with variable populations of 15,000,
6000 and 5000 respectively. About 15 m. S. of Lima, near the
mouth of the Lurin, are the celebrated ruins of Pachacamac,
which are believed to antedate the occupation of this region
by the Incas.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LIMA,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> the principal city and the capital of Peru and of the
department and province of Lima, on the left bank of the river
Rimac, 7½ m. above its mouth and the same distance E. by N.
of its seaport Callao, in 12° 2&prime; 34&Prime; S., 77° 7&prime; 36&Prime; W. Pop. (1906
estimate) 140,000, of whom a large proportion is of negro
descent, and a considerable number of foreign birth. The city
is about 480 ft. above sea-level, and stands on an arid plain,
which rises gently toward the S., and occupies an angle between
the Cerros de San Jeronimo (2493 ft.) and San Cristobal (1411 ft.)
on the N. and a short range of low hills, called the Cerros de San
Bartolomé, on the E. The surrounding region is arid, like all
this part of the Pacific coast, but through irrigation large areas
have been brought under cultivation, especially along the watercourses.
The Rimac has its source about 105 m. N.E. of Lima
and is fed by the melting snows of the higher Andes. It is an
insignificant stream in winter and a raging torrent in summer.
Its tributaries are all of the same character, except the Rio Surco,
which rises near Chorrillos and flowing northward joins the
Rimac a few miles above the city. These, with the Rio Lurin,
which enters the Pacific a short distance S. of Chorrillos, provide
water for irrigating the districts near Lima. The climate varies
somewhat from that of the arid coast in general, in having a
winter of four months characterized by cloudy skies, dense fogs
and sometimes a drizzling rain. The air in this season is raw
and chilly. For the rest of the year the sky is clear and the air
dry. The mean temperature for the year is 66° F., the winter
minimum being 59° and the summer maximum 78°.</p>

<p>The older part of Lima was laid out and built with mathematical
regularity, the streets crossing each other at right
angles and enclosing square areas, called <i>manzanas</i>, of nearly
uniform size. Later extensions, however, did not follow this
plan strictly, and there is some variation from the straight line
in the streets and also in the size and shape of the manzanas.
The streets are roughly paved with cobble stones and lighted
with gas or electricity. A broad boulevard of modern construction
partly encircles the city, occupying the site of the old
brick walls (18 to 20 ft. high, 10 to 12 ft. thick at the base and
9 ft. at the top) which were constructed in 1585 by a Fleming
named Pedro Ramon, and were razed by Henry Meiggs during
the administration of President Balta. The water-supply is
derived from the Rimac and filtered, and the drainage, once
carried on the surface, now passes into a system of subterranean
sewers. The streets and suburbs of Lima are served by tramways,
mostly worked by electric traction. The suburban lines include
two to Callao, one to Magdalena, and one to Miraflores and
Chorrillos. On the north side of the river is the suburb or
district of San Lazaro, shut in by the encircling hills and occupied
in great part by the poorer classes. The principal squares are
the Plaza Mayor, Plaza Bolívar (formerly P. de la Inquisicion
and P. de la Independencia), Plaza de la Exposicion, and Plaza
del Acho, on the north side of the river, the site of the bull-ring.
The public gardens, connected with the Exposition palace on the
S. side of the city, and the Paseo Colon are popular among
the Limeños as pleasure resorts. The long Paseo Colon, with
its parallel drives and paths, is ornamented with trees, shrubbery
and statues, notably the Columbus statue, a group in marble
designed by the sculptor Salvatore Revelli. It is the favourite
fashionable resort. A part of the old wagon road from Lima to
Callao, which was paved and improved with walks and trees
by viceroy O&rsquo;Higgins, is also much frequented. The avenue
(3 m. long) leading from the city to Magdalena was beautified
by the planting of four rows of palms during the Pierola administration.
Among other public resorts are the Botanical garden,
the Grau and Bolognesi avenues (parts of the Boulevard), the
Acho avenue on the right bank of the Rimac, and the celebrated
avenue of the Descalzos, on the N. side of the river, bordered
with statuary. The noteworthy monuments of the city are
the bronze equestrian statue of Bolívar in the plaza of that name,
the Columbus statue already mentioned, the Bolognesi statue
in the small square of that name, and the San Martin statue in
the Plaza de la Exposicion. The 22nd of May monument, a
marble shaft crowned by a golden bronze figure of Victory,
stands where the Callao road crosses the Boulevard. Most
conspicuous among the public buildings of Lima is the cathedral,
whose twin towers and broad façade look down upon the Plaza
Mayor. Its foundation stone was laid in 1535 but the cathedral
was not consecrated until 1625. The great earthquake of 1746
reduced it to a mass of ruins, but it was reconstructed by 1758,
practically, as it now stands. It has double aisles and ten
richly-decorated chapels, in one of which rest the remains of
Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of Peru. Also facing the same
square are the archiepiscopal and government palaces; the
latter formerly the palace of the viceroys. The interesting <i>casa</i>
of the Inquisition, whose tribunals rivalled those of Madrid in
cruelty, faces upon Plaza Bolívar, as also the old University of
San Marcos, which dates from 1551 and has faculties of theology,
law, medicine, philosophy and literature, mathematics, and
administrative and political economy. The churches and
convents of Lima are richly endowed as a rule, and some of the
churches represent a very large expenditure of money. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page690" id="page690"></a>690</span>
convent of San Francisco, near the Plaza Mayor, is the largest
monastic establishment in Lima and contains some very fine
carvings. Its church is the finest in the city after the cathedral.
Other noteworthy churches are those of the convents of Santo
Domingo, La Merced and San Augustine. There are a number
of conventual establishments (for both sexes), which, with their
chapels, and with the smaller churches, retreats, sanctuaries, &amp;c.,
make up a total of 66 institutions devoted to religious observances.
An attractive, and perhaps the most popular public
building in Lima is the Exposition palace on the plaza and in
the public gardens of the same name, on the south side of the
city. It dates from 1872; its halls are used for important public
assemblies, and its upper floor is occupied by the National
Historical Institute, its museum and the gallery of historical
paintings. Other noteworthy edifices and institutions are the
National Library, the Lima Geographical Society, founded in
1888; the Mint, which dates from 1565 and is considered to be
one of the best in South America; the great bull-ring of the Plaza
del Acho, which dates from 1768 and can seat 8000 spectators;
the Concepcion market; a modern penitentiary; and various
charitable institutions. In addition to the old university on the
Plaza Bolívar, which has been modernized and greatly improved,
Lima has a school of engineers and mines (founded 1876), the
old college of San Carlos, a normal school (founded 1905), a
school of agriculture (situated outside the city limits and founded
in 1902), two schools for girls under the direction of religious
sisters, an episcopal seminary called the Seminario Conciliar
de Santo Toribio, and a school of arts and trades in which
elementary technical instruction is given. Under the old régime,
primary instruction was almost wholly neglected, but the 20th
century brought about important changes in this respect.
In addition to the primary schools, the government maintains
free night schools for workmen.</p>

<p>The residences of the city are for the most part of one storey
and have mud walls supported by a wooden framework which
enclose open spaces, called <i>patios</i>, around which the living rooms
are ranged. The better class of dwellings have two floors and
are sometimes built of brick. A projecting, lattice-enclosed
window for the use of women is a prominent feature of the larger
houses and gives a picturesque effect to the streets.</p>

<p>Manufacturing has had some considerable development since
the closing years of the 19th century; the most important
manufactories are established outside the city limits; they produce
cotton and woollen textiles, the products of the sugar estates,
chocolate, cocaine, cigars and cigarettes, beer, artificial liquors,
cotton-seed oil, hats, macaroni, matches, paper, soap and candles.
The commercial interests of the city are important, a large part
of the interior being supplied from this point. With its port
Callao the city is connected by two steam railways, one of which
was built as early as 1848; one railway runs northward to Ancon,
and another, the famous Oroya line, runs inland 130 m., crossing
the Western Cordillera at an elevation of 15,645 ft. above sea-level,
with branches to Cerro de Pasco and Huari. The export
trade properly belongs to Callao, though often credited to Lima.
The Limeños are an intelligent, hospitable, pleasure-loving
people, and the many attractive features of their city make it a
favourite place of residence for foreigners.</p>

<p>Lima was founded on the 18th of January 1535 by Francisco
Pizarro, who named it Ciudad de los Reyes (City of the Kings) in
honour of the emperor Charles V. and Doña Juana his mother,
or, according to some authorities, in commemoration of the
Feast of the Epiphany (6th January) when its site is said to have
been selected. The name soon after gave place to that of Lima,
a Spanish corruption of the Quichua word Rimac. In 1541
Lima was made an episcopal see, which in 1545 was raised to a
metropolitan see. Under Spanish rule, Lima was the principal
city of South America, and for a time was the entrepôt for all the
Pacific coast colonies south of Panama. It became very prosperous
during this period, though often visited by destructive earthquakes,
the most disastrous of which was that of the 28th of
October 1746, when the cathedral and the greater part of the
city were reduced to ruins, many lives were lost, and the port of
Callao was destroyed. Lima was not materially affected by the
military operations of the war of independence until 1821, when
a small army of Argentines and Chileans under General San
Martin invested the city, and took possession of it on the 12th
of July upon the withdrawal of the Spanish forces. San Martin
was proclaimed the protector of Peru as a free state on the
28th of July, but resigned that office on the 20th of September
1822 to avoid a fratricidal struggle with Bolívar. In March
1828 Lima was again visited by a destructive earthquake, and
in 1854-1855 an epidemic of yellow fever carried off a great
number of its inhabitants. In November 1864, when a hostile
Spanish fleet was on the coast, a congress of South American
plenipotentiaries was held here to concert measures of mutual
defence. Lima has been the principal sufferer in the many
revolutions and disorders which have convulsed Peru under the
republic, and many of them originated in the city itself. During
the earlier part of this period the capital twice fell into the hands
of foreigners, once in 1836 when the Bolivian general Santa
Cruz made himself the chief of a Bolivian-Peruvian confederation,
and again in 1837 when an invading force of Chileans and
Peruvian refugees landed at Ancon and defeated the Peruvian
forces under President Orbegoso. The city prospered greatly
under the two administrations of President Ramon Castilla,
who gave Peru its first taste of peace and good government,
and under those of Presidents Balta and Pardo, during which
many important public improvements were made. The greatest
calamity in the history of Lima was its occupation by a Chilean
army under the command of General Baquedano after the bloody
defeat of the Peruvians at Miraflores on the 15th of January
1881. Chorrillos and Miraflores with their handsome country
residences had already been sacked and burned and their helpless
residents murdered. Lima escaped this fate, thanks to the
intervention of foreign powers, but during the two years and
nine months of this occupation the Chileans systematically
pillaged the public edifices, turned the old university of San
Marcos into barracks, destroyed the public library, and carried
away the valuable contents of the Exposition palace, the models
and apparatus of the medical school and other educational
institutions, and many of the monuments and art treasures with
which the city had been enriched. A forced contribution of
$1,000,000 a month was imposed upon the population in
addition to the revenues of the custom house. When the Chilean
garrison under Captain Lynch was withdrawn on the 22nd of
October 1883, it took 3000 wagons to carry away the plunder
which had not already been shipped. Of the government palace
and other public buildings nothing remained but the bare walls.
The buoyant character of the people, and the sympathy and
assistance generously offered by many civilized nations, contributed
to a remarkably speedy recovery from so great a
misfortune. Under the direction of its keeper, Don Ricardo
Palma, 8315 volumes of the public library were recovered, to
which were added valuable contributions from other countries.
The portraits of the Spanish viceroys were also recovered, except
five, and are now in the portrait gallery of the Exposition palace.
The poverty of the country after the war made recovery difficult,
but years of peace have assisted it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMAÇON<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>limax</i>, a slug), a curve invented by
Blaise Pascal and further investigated and named by Gilles
Personne de Roberval. It is generated by the extremities of a
rod which is constrained to move so that its middle point traces
out a circle, the rod always passing through a fixed point on the
circumference. The polar equation is <i>r</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> cos &theta;, where
2<i>a</i> = length of the rod, and <i>b</i> = diameter of the circle. The curve
may be regarded as an epitrochoid (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Epicycloid</a></span>) in which the
rolling and fixed circles have equal radii. It is the inverse of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page691" id="page691"></a>691</span>
central conic for the focus, and the first positive pedal of a circle
for any point. The form of the limaçon depends on the ratio of
the two constants; if <i>a</i> be greater
than <i>b</i>, the curve lies entirely outside
the circle; if <i>a</i> equals <i>b</i>, it is known
as a cardioid (<i>q.v.</i>); if <i>a</i> is less than
<i>b</i>, the curve has a node within the
circle; the particular case when
<i>b</i> = 2<i>a</i> is known as the trisectrix
(<i>q.v.</i>). In the figure (1) is a limaçon,
(2) the cardioid, (3) the trisectrix.</p>

<p>Properties of the limaçon may be
deduced from its mechanical construction;
thus the length of a focal
chord is constant and the normals at
the extremities of a focal chord intersect on a fixed circle.
The area is (<i>b</i>² + <i>a</i>²/2)&pi;, and the length is expressible as an
elliptic integral.</p>

<i>limr</i>, Swed. and Dan. <i>lem</i>; probably the word is to be referred
to a root <i>li</i>- seen in an obsolete English word &ldquo;lith,&rdquo; a limb, and
in the Ger. <i>Glied</i>), originally any portion or member of the body,
but now restricted in meaning to the external members of the
body of an animal apart from the head and trunk, the legs and
arms, or, in a bird, the wings. It is sometimes used of the lower
limbs only, and is synonymous with &ldquo;leg.&rdquo; The word is also
used of the main branches of a tree, of the projecting spurs of a
range of mountains, of the arms of a cross, &amp;c. As a translation
of the Lat. <i>membrum</i>, and with special reference to the church
as the &ldquo;body of Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;limb&rdquo; was frequently used by
ecclesiastical writers of the 16th and 17th centuries of a person
as being a component part of the church; cf. such expressions
as &ldquo;limb of Satan,&rdquo; &ldquo;limb of the law,&rdquo; &amp;c. From the use of
<i>membrum</i> in medieval Latin for an estate dependent on another,
the name &ldquo;limb&rdquo; is given to an outlying portion of another,
or to the <span class="correction" title="amended from surbordinate">subordinate</span> members of the Cinque Ports, attached to
one of the principal towns; Pevensey was thus a &ldquo;limb&rdquo; of
Hastings. (2) An edge or border, frequently used in scientific
language for the boundary of a surface. It is thus used of the
edge of the disk of the sun or moon, of the expanded part of a

<p><span class="bold">LIMBER,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> an homonymous word, having three meanings.
(1) A two-wheeled carriage forming a detachable part of the
equipment of all guns on travelling carriages and having on it a
framework to contain ammunition boxes, and, in most cases,
seats for two or three gunners. The French equivalent is <i>avant-train</i>,
the Ger. <i>Protz</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artillery</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ordnance</a></span>). (2) An
adjective meaning pliant or flexible and so used with reference
to a person&rsquo;s mental or bodily qualities, quick, nimble, adroit.
(3) A nautical term for the holes cut in the flooring in a ship
above the keelson, to allow water to drain to the pumps.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The etymology of these words is obscure. According to the
<i>New English Dictionary</i> the origin of (1) is to be found in the Fr.
<i>limonière</i>, a derivative of <i>limon</i>, the shaft of a vehicle, a meaning
which appears in English from the 15th century but is now obsolete,
except apparently among the miners of the north of England. The
earlier English forms of the word are <i>lymor</i> or <i>limmer</i>. Skeat suggests
that (2) is connected with &ldquo;limp,&rdquo; which he refers to a Teutonic
base <i>lap</i>-, meaning to hang down. The <i>New English Dictionary</i>
points out that while &ldquo;limp&rdquo; does not occur till the beginning of
the 18th century, &ldquo;limber&rdquo; in this sense is found as early as the
16th. In Thomas Cooper&rsquo;s (1517?-1594) <i>Thesaurus Linguae Romanae
et Britannicae</i> (1565), it appears as the English equivalent of the
Latin <i>lentus</i>. A possible derivation connects it with &ldquo;limb.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMBORCH, PHILIPP VAN<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1633-1712), Dutch Remonstrant
theologian, was born on the 19th of June 1633, at Amsterdam,
where his father was a lawyer. He received his education at
Utrecht, at Leiden, in his native city, and finally at Utrecht
University, which he entered in 1652. In 1657 he became a
Remonstrant pastor at Gouda, and in 1667 he was transferred to
Amsterdam, where, in the following year, the office of professor
of theology in the Remonstrant seminary was added to his
pastoral charge. He was a friend of John Locke. He died at
Amsterdam on the 30th of April 1712.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His most important work, <i>Institutiones theologiae christianae, ad
praxin pietatis et promotionem pacis christianae unice directae</i>
(Amsterdam, 1686, 5th ed., 1735), is a full and clear exposition of
the system of Simon Episcopius and Stephan Curcellaeus. The
fourth edition (1715) included a posthumous &ldquo;Relatio historica de
origine et progressu controversiarum in foederato Belgio de praedestinatione.&rdquo;
Limborch also wrote <i>De veritate religionis Christianae
amica collatio cum erudito Judaeo</i> (Gouda, 1687); <i>Historia Inquisitionis</i>
(1692), in four books prefixed to the &ldquo;Liber Sententiarum
Inquisitionis Tolosanae&rdquo; (1307-1323); and <i>Commentarius in Acta
Apostolorum et in Epistolas ad Romanos et ad Hebraeos</i> (Rotterdam,
1711). His editorial labours included the publication of various
works of his predecessors, and of <i>Epistolae ecclesiasticae praestantium
ac eruditorum virorum</i> (Amsterdam, 1684), chiefly by Jakobus
Arminius, Joannes Uytenbogardus, Konrad Vorstius (1569-1622),
Gerhard Vossius (1577-1649), Hugo Grotius, Simon Episcopius

<p><span class="bold">LIMBURG,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> one of the many small feudal states into which the
duchy of Lower Lorraine was split up in the second half of the
11th century. The first count, Walram of Arlon, married Judith
the daughter of Frederick of Luxemburg, duke of Lower Lorraine
(d. 1065), who bestowed upon him a portion of his possessions
lying upon both sides of the river Meuse. It received its name
from the strong castle built by Count Walram on the river Vesdre,
where the town of Limburg now stands. Henry, Walram&rsquo;s son
(d. 1119), was turbulent and ambitious. On the death of Godfrey
of Bouillon (1089) he forced the emperor Henry IV. to recognize
him as duke of Lower Lorraine. He was afterwards deposed
and imprisoned by Count Godfrey of Louvain on whom the ducal
title had been bestowed by the emperor Henry V. (1106). For
three generations the possession of the ducal title was disputed
between the rival houses of Limburg and Louvain. At length
a reconciliation took place (1155); the name of duke of Lower
Lorraine henceforth disappears, the rulers of the territory on the
Meuse become dukes of Limburg, those of the larger territory to
the west dukes of Brabant. With the death of Duke Walram IV.
(1280) the succession passed to his daughter, Irmingardis,
who was married to Reinald I., count of Guelders. Irmingardis
died without issue (1282), and her cousin, Count Adolph of Berg,
laid claim to the duchy. His rights were disputed by Reinald,
who was in possession and was recognized by the emperor. Too
weak to assert his claim by force of arms Adolph sold his rights
(1283) to John, duke of Brabant (<i>q.v.</i>). This led to a long and
desolating war for five years, at the end of which (1288), finding
the power of Brabant superior to his own Reinald in his turn sold
his rights to count Henry III. of Luxemburg. Henry and Reinald,
supported by the archbishop of Cologne and other allies, now
raised a great army. The rival forces met at Woeringen (5th of
June 1288) and John of Brabant (<i>q.v.</i>) gained a complete victory.
It proved decisive, the duchies of Limburg and Brabant passing
under the rule of a common sovereign. The duchy comprised
during this period the bailiwicks of Hervé, Montzen, Baelen,
Sprimont and Wallhorn, and the counties of Rolduc, Daelhem
and Falkenberg, to which was added in 1530 the town of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page692" id="page692"></a>692</span>
Maastricht. The provisions and privileges of the famous Charter
of Brabant, the <i>Joyeuse Entrée</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), were from the 15th century
extended to Limburg and remained in force until the French
Revolution. By the treaty of Westphalia (1648) the duchy was
divided into two portions, the counties of Daelhem and Falkenberg
with the town of Maastricht being ceded by Spain to the
United Provinces, where they formed what was known as a
&ldquo;Generality-Land.&rdquo; At the peace of Rastatt (1714) the southern
portion passed under the dominion of the Austrian Habsburgs
and formed part of the Austrian Netherlands until the French
conquest in 1794. During the period of French rule (1794-1814)
Limburg was included in the two French departments of
Ourthe and Meuse Inférieure. In 1814 the old name of Limburg
was restored to one of the provinces of the newly created kingdom
of the Netherlands, but the new Limburg comprised besides
the ancient duchy, a piece of Gelderland and the county of Looz.
At the revolution of 1830 Limburg, with the exception of Maastricht,
threw in its lot with the Belgians, and during the nine
years that King William refused to recognize the existence of the
kingdom of Belgium the Limburgers sent representatives to the
legislature at Brussels and were treated as Belgians. When in
1839 the Dutch king suddenly announced his intention of
accepting the terms of the settlement proposed by the treaty of
London, as drawn up by representatives of the great powers
in 1831, Belgium found herself compelled to relinquish portions
of Limburg and Luxemburg. The part of Limburg that lay on
the right bank of the Meuse, together with the town of Maastricht
and a number of communes&mdash;Weert, Haelen, Kepel, Horst, &amp;c.&mdash;on
the left bank of the river, became a sovereign duchy under
the rule of the king of Holland. In exchange for the cession of
the rights of the Germanic confederation over the portion of
Luxemburg, which was annexed by the treaty to Belgium, the
duchy of Limburg (excepting the communes of Maastricht and
Venloo) was declared to belong to the Germanic confederation.
This somewhat unsatisfactory condition of affairs continued
until 1866, when at a conference of the great powers, held in
London to consider the Luxemburg question (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Luxemburg</a></span>),
it was agreed that Limburg should be freed from every political
tie with Germany. Limburg became henceforth an integral part
of Dutch territory.</p>

It represents only a portion of the ancient duchy of Limburg
(see above). The part east of the Meuse was transferred to
Holland by the London conference, and a further portion was
attached to the province of Liége including the old capital now
called Dolhain. Much of the province is represented by the wild
heath district called the Campine, recently discovered to form
an extensive coal-field. The operations for working it were only
begun in 1906. North-west of Hasselt is Beverloo, where all the
Belgian troops go through a course of instruction annually.
Among the towns are Hasselt, the capital, St Trond and Looz.
From the last named is derived the title of the family known as
the dukes of Looz, whose antiquity equals that of the extinct
reigning family of Limburg itself. The title of duc de Looz is one
of the four existing ducal titles in the Netherlands, the other
three being d&rsquo;Arenberg, Croy and d&rsquo;Ursel. Limburg contains

1235. It was restored in 1872-1878. Limburg has a castle, a
new town hall and a seminary for the education of priests; its
industries include the manufacture of cloth, tobacco, soap,
machinery, pottery and leather. Limburg, which was a flourishing
place during the middle ages, had its own line of counts until
1414, when it was purchased by the elector of Trier. It passed
to Nassau in 1803. In September 1796 it was the scene of a
victory gained by the Austrians under the archduke Charles
over the French.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMBURGITE,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> in petrology, a dark-coloured volcanic rock
resembling basalt in appearance, but containing normally no
felspar. The name is taken from Limburg (Germany), where they
occur in the well-known rock of the Kaiserstuhl. They consist
essentially of olivine and augite with a brownish glassy ground
mass. The augite may be green, but more commonly is brown
or violet; the olivine is usually pale green or colourless, but is
sometimes yellow (hyalosiderite). In the ground mass a second
generation of small eumorphic augites frequently occurs; more
rarely olivine is present also as an ingredient of the matrix.
The principal accessory minerals are titaniferous iron oxides and
apatite. Felspar though sometimes present is never abundant,
and nepheline also is unusual. In some limburgites large
phenocysts of dark brown hornblende and biotite are found,
mostly with irregular borders blackened by resorption; in others
there are large crystals of soda orthoclase or anorthoclase.
Hauyne is an ingredient of some of the limburgites of the Cape
Verde Islands. Rocks of this group occur in considerable
numbers in Germany (Rhine district) and in Bohemia, also in
Scotland, Auvergne, Spain, Africa (Kilimanjaro), Brazil, &amp;c.
They are associated principally with basalts, nepheline and
leucite basalts and monchiquites. From the last-named rocks
the limburgites are not easily separated as the two classes bear
a very close resemblance in structure and in mineral composition,
though many authorities believe that the ground mass of the
monchiquites is not a glass but crystalline analcite. Limburgites
may occur as flows, as sills or dykes, and are sometimes highly
vesicular. Closely allied to them are the <i>augitites</i>, which are
distinguished only by the absence of olivine; examples are
known from Bohemia, Auvergne, the Canary Islands, Ireland, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMBUS<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;edge,&rdquo; &ldquo;fringe,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> of a garment), a
theological term denoting the border of hell, where dwell those
who, while not condemned to torture, yet are deprived of the
joy of heaven. The more common form in English is &ldquo;limbo,&rdquo;
which is used both in the technical theological sense and derivatively
in the sense of &ldquo;prison,&rdquo; or for the condition of being
lost, deserted, obsolete. In theology there are (1) the <i>Limbus
Infantum</i>, and (2) the <i>Limbus Patrum</i>.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Limbus Infantum</i> or <i>Puerorum</i> is the abode to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page693" id="page693"></a>693</span>
human beings dying without actual sin, but with their original
sin unwashed away by baptism, were held to be consigned; the
category included, not unbaptized infants merely, but also
idiots, cretins and the like. The word &ldquo;limbus,&rdquo; in the theological
application, occurs first in the <i>Summa</i> of Thomas Aquinas;
for its extensive currency it is perhaps most indebted to the
<i>Commedia</i> of Dante (<i>Inf.</i> c. 4). The question as to the destiny
of infants dying unbaptized presented itself to theologians at
a comparatively early period. Generally speaking it may be
said that the Greek fathers inclined to a cheerful and the Latin
fathers to a gloomy view. Thus Gregory of Nazianzus (<i>Orat.</i> 40)
says &ldquo;that such children as die unbaptized without their own
fault shall neither be glorified nor punished by the righteous
Judge, as having done no wickedness, though they die unbaptized,
and as rather suffering loss than being the authors of
it.&rdquo; Similar opinions were expressed by Gregory of Nyssa,
Severus of Antioch and others&mdash;opinions which it is almost
impossible to distinguish from the Pelagian view that children
dying unbaptized might be admitted to eternal life, though not
to the kingdom of God. In his recoil from Pelagian heresy,
Augustine was compelled to sharpen the antithesis between the
state of the saved and that of the lost, and taught that there
are only two alternatives&mdash;to be with Christ or with the devil,
to be with Him or against Him. Following up, as he thought,
his master&rsquo;s teaching, Fulgentius declared that it is to be believed
as an indubitable truth that, &ldquo;not only men who have come to
the use of reason, but infants dying, whether in their mother&rsquo;s
womb or after birth, without baptism in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, are punished with everlasting punishment
in eternal fire.&rdquo; Later theologians and schoolmen followed
Augustine in rejecting the notion of any final position intermediate
between heaven and hell, but otherwise inclined to take
the mildest possible view of the destiny of the irresponsible and
unbaptized. Thus the proposition of Innocent III. that &ldquo;the
punishment of original sin is deprivation of the vision of God&rdquo;
is practically repeated by Aquinas, Scotus, and all the other
great theologians of the scholastic period, the only outstanding
exception being that of Gregory of Rimini, who on this account
was afterwards called &ldquo;tortor infantum.&rdquo; The first authoritative
declaration of the Latin Church upon this subject was that made
by the second council of Lyons (1274), and confirmed by the
council of Florence (1439), with the concurrence of the representatives
of the Greek Church, to the effect that &ldquo;the souls of
those who die in mortal sin or in original sin only forthwith
descend into hell, but to be punished with unequal punishments.&rdquo;
Perrone remarks (<i>Prael. Theol.</i> pt. iii. chap. 6, art. 4) that the
damnation of infants and also the comparative lightness of the
punishment involved in this are thus <i>de fide</i>; but nothing is
determined as to the place which they occupy in hell, as to what
constitutes the disparity of their punishment, or as to their
condition after the day of judgment. In the council of Trent
there was considerable difference of opinion as to what was
implied in deprivation of the vision of God, and no definition
was attempted, the Dominicans maintaining the severer view
that the &ldquo;limbus infantum&rdquo; was a dark subterranean fireless
chamber, while the Franciscans placed it in a region of light
above the earth. Some theologians continue to maintain with
Bellarmine that the infants &ldquo;in limbo&rdquo; are affected with some
degree of sadness on account of a felt privation; others, following
the <i>Nodus praedestinationis</i> of Celestine Sfrondati (1649-1696),
hold that they enjoy every kind of natural felicity, as regards
their souls now, and as regards their bodies after the resurrection,
just as if Adam had not sinned. In the condemnation (1794)
of the synod of Pistoia (1786), the twenty-sixth article declares
it to be false, rash and injurious to treat as Pelagian the doctrine
that those dying in original sin are not punished with fire, as if
that meant that there is an intermediate place, free from fault
and punishment, between the kingdom of God and everlasting
damnation.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Limbus Patrum</i>, <i>Limbus Inferni</i> or <i>Sinus Abrahae</i>
(&ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s Bosom&rdquo;), is defined in Roman Catholic theology
as the place in the underworld where the saints of the Old
Testament were confined until liberated by Christ on his &ldquo;descent
into hell.&rdquo; Regarding the locality and its pleasantness or
painfulness nothing has been taught as <i>de fide</i>. It is sometimes
regarded as having been closed and empty since Christ&rsquo;s descent,
but other authors do not think of it as separate in place from the
<i>limbus infantum</i>. The whole idea, in the Latin Church, has been
justly described as the mere <i>caput mortuum</i> of the old catholic
doctrine of Hades, which was gradually superseded in the West
by that of purgatory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIME<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>lim</i>, Lat. <i>limus</i>, mud, from <i>linere</i>, to smear), the
name given to a viscous exudation of the holly-tree, used for
snaring birds and known as &ldquo;bird-lime.&rdquo; In chemistry, it is
the popular name of calcium oxide, CaO, a substance employed
in very early times as a component of mortars and cementing
materials. It is prepared by the burning of limestone (a process
described by Dioscorides and Pliny) in kilns similar to those
described under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cement</a></span>. The value and subsequent treatment
of the product depend on the purity of the limestone; a pure
stone yields a &ldquo;fat&rdquo; lime which readily slakes; an impure stone,
especially if magnesia be present, yields an almost unslakable
&ldquo;poor&rdquo; lime. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cement</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Concrete</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mortar</a></span>, for details.</p>

<p>Pure calcium oxide &ldquo;quick-lime,&rdquo; obtained by heating the
pure carbonate, is a white amorphous substance, which can be
readily melted and boiled in the electric furnace, cubic and
acicular crystals being deposited on cooling the vapour. It
combines with water, evolving much heat and crumbling to
pieces; this operation is termed &ldquo;slaking&rdquo; and the resulting
product &ldquo;slaked lime&rdquo;; it is chemically equivalent to the
conversion of the oxide into hydrate. A solution of the hydrate
in water, known as lime-water, has a weakly alkaline reaction;
it is employed in the detection of carbonic acid. &ldquo;Milk of lime&rdquo;
consists of a cream of the hydrate and water. Dry lime has no
action upon chlorine, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide,
although in the presence of water combination ensues.</p>

<p>In medicine lime-water, applied externally, is an astringent
and desiccative, and it enters into the preparation of linamentum
calcis and carron oil which are employed to heal burns,
eczema, &amp;c. Applied internally, lime-water is an antacid; it
prevents the curdling of milk in large lumps (hence its prescription
for infants); it also acts as a gastric sedative. Calcium
phosphate is much employed in treating rickets, and calcium
chloride in haemoptysis and haemophylia. It is an antidote for
mineral and oxalic acid poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIME,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span><a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> or <span class="sc">Linden</span>. The lime trees, species of <i>Tilia</i>, are
familiar timber trees with sweet-scented, honeyed flowers, which
are borne on a common peduncle proceeding from the middle of
a long bract. The genus, which gives the name to the natural
order Tiliaceae, contains about ten species of trees, natives of
the north temperate zone. The general name <i>Tilia europaea</i>,
the name given by Linnaeus to the European lime, includes
several well-marked sub-species, often regarded as distinct
species. These are: (1) the small-leaved lime, <i>T. parvifolia</i>
(or <i>T. cordata</i>), probably wild in woods in England and also wild
throughout Europe, except in the extreme south-east, and
Russian Asia. (2) <i>T. intermedia</i>, the common lime, which is
widely planted in Britain but not wild there, has a less northerly
distribution than <i>T. cordata</i>, from which it differs in its somewhat
larger leaves and downy fruit. (3) The large-leaved lime,
<i>T. platyphyllos</i> (or <i>T. grandifolia</i>), occurs only as an introduction
in Britain, and is wild in Europe south of Denmark. It differs
from the other two limes in its larger leaves, often 4 in. across,
which are downy beneath, its downy twigs and its prominently
ribbed fruit. The lime sometimes acquires a great size; one is
recorded in Norfolk as being 16 yds. in circumference, and Ray
mentions one of the same girth. The famous linden tree which
gave the town of Neuenstadt in Württemberg the name of
&ldquo;<i>Neuenstadt an der grossen Linden</i>&rdquo; was 9 ft. in diameter.</p>

<p>The lime is a very favourite tree. It is an object of beauty in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page694" id="page694"></a>694</span>
the spring when the delicately transparent green leaves are
bursting from the protection of the pink and white stipules,
which have formed the bud-scales, and retains its fresh green
during early summer. Later, the fragrance of its flowers, rich
in honey, attracts innumerable bees; in the autumn the foliage
becomes a clear yellow but soon falls. Among the many famous
avenues of limes may be mentioned that which gave the name
to one of the best-known ways in Berlin, &ldquo;Unter den Linden,&rdquo;
and the avenue at Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The economic value of the tree chiefly lies in the inner bark or
liber (Lat. for bark), called bast, and the wood. The former was
used for paper and mats and for tying garlands by the ancients
(<i>Od.</i> i. 38; Pliny xvi. 14. 25, xxiv. 8. 33). Bast mats are now made
chiefly in Russia, the bark being cut in long strips, when the liber
is easily separable from the corky superficial layer. It is then plaited
into mats about 2 yds. square; 14,000,000 come to Britain annually,
chiefly from Archangel. The wood is used by carvers, being soft and
light, and by architects in framing the models of buildings. Turners
use it for light bowls, &amp;c. <i>T. americana</i> (bass-wood) is one of the
most common trees in the forests of Canada and extends into the
eastern and southern United States. It is sawn into lumber and
under the name of white-wood used in the manufacture of wooden
ware, cheap furniture, &amp;c., and also for paper pulp (C. S. Sargent,
<i>Silva of North America</i>). It was cultivated by Philip Miller at
Chelsea in 1752.</p>

<p>The common lime was well known to the ancients. Theophrastus
says the leaves are sweet and used for fodder for most kinds of
cattle. Pliny alludes to the use of the liber and wood, and describes
the tree as growing in the mountain-valleys of Italy (xvi. 30). See
also Virg. <i>Geo.</i> i. 173, &amp;c.; Ov. <i>Met.</i> viii. 621, x. 92. Allusion to
the lightness of the wood is made in Aristoph. <i>Birds</i>, 1378.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMERICK,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> a western county of Ireland, in the province of
Munster, bounded N. by the estuary of the Shannon and the
counties of Clare and Tipperary, E. by Tipperary, S. by Cork
and W. by Kerry. The area is 680,842 acres, or about 1064 sq. m.
The greater part of the county is comparatively level, but in the
south-east the picturesque Galtees, which extend into Tipperary,
attain in Galtymore a height of 3015 ft., and on the west, stretching
into Kerry, there is a circular amphitheatre of less elevated
mountains. The Shannon is navigable for large vessels to
Limerick, above which are the rapids of Doonas and Castleroy,
and a canal. The Shannon is widely famous as a sporting river,
and Castleconnell is a well-known centre. The Maigne, which
rises in the Galtees and flows into the Shannon, is navigable
as far as the town of Adare.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>This is mainly a Carboniferous Limestone county, with fairly
level land, broken by ridges of Old Red Sandstone. On the north-east,
the latter rock rises on Slievefelim, round a Silurian core, to
1523 ft. In the south, Old Red Sandstone rises above an enclosed
area of Silurian shales at Ballylanders, the opposite scarp of Old Red
Sandstone forming the Ballyhoura Hills on the Cork border. Volcanic
ashes, andesites, basalts and intrusive sheets of basic rock,
mark an eruptive episode in the Carboniferous Limestone. These
are well seen under Carrigogunnell Castle, and in a ring of hills round
Ballybrood. At Ballybrood, Upper Carboniferous beds occur, as
an outlier of a large area that links the west of the county with the
north of Kerry. The coals in the west are not of commercial value.
Lead-ore has been worked in places in the limestone.</p>

<p>Limerick includes the greater part of the Golden Vale, the most
fertile district of Ireland, which stretches from Cashel in Tipperary
nearly to the town of Limerick. Along the banks of the Shannon
there are large tracts of flat meadow land formed of deposits of
calcareous and peaty matter, exceedingly fertile. The soil in the
mountainous districts is for the most part thin and poor, and incapable
of improvement. The large farms occupy the low grounds,
and are almost wholly devoted to grazing. The acreage under
tillage decreases, the proportion to pasturage being as one to nearly
three. All the crops (of which oats and potatoes are the principal)
show a decrease, but there is a growing acreage of meadow land.
The numbers of live stock, on the other hand, are on the whole well
maintained, and cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and poultry are all extensively
reared. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in agriculture,
but coarse woollens are manufactured, and also paper,
and there are many meal and flour mills. Formerly there were
flax-spinning and weaving mills, but the industry is now practically
extinct. Limerick is the headquarters of an important salmon-fishery
on the Shannon. The railway communications are entirely
included in the Great Southern and Western system, whose main
line crosses the south-eastern corner of the county, with two branches
to the city of Limerick from Limerick Junction and from Charleville,
and lines from Limerick south-westward to Tralee in county Kerry,
and to Foynes on the Shannon estuary. Limerick is also served by a
line from the north through county Tipperary. The port of Limerick,
at the head of the estuary, is the most important on the west coast.</p>

<p>The county includes 14 baronies. The number of members
returned to the Irish parliament was eight, two being returned for
each of the boroughs of Askeaton and Kilmallock, in addition to
two returned for the county, and two for the county of the city of
Limerick. The present county parliamentary divisions are the
east and west, each returning one member. The population (158,912
in 1891, 146,098 in 1901) shows a decrease somewhat under the
average of the Irish counties generally, emigration being, however,
extensive; of the total about 94% are Roman Catholics, and
about 73% are rural. The chief towns are Limerick (pop. 38,151),
Rathkeale (1749) and Newcastle or Newcastle West (2599). The
city of Limerick constitutes a county in itself. Assizes are held at
Limerick, and quarter-sessions at Bruff, Limerick, Newcastle and
Rathkeale. The county is divided between the Protestant dioceses
of Cashel, Killaloe and Limerick; and between the Roman Catholic
dioceses of the same names.</p>
</div>

<p>Limerick was included in the kingdom of Thomond. Afterwards
it had a separate existence under the name of Aine-Cliach.
From the 8th to the 11th century it was partly occupied by the
Danes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Limerick</a></span>, City). As a county, Limerick is one of the
twelve generally considered to owe their formation to King John.
By Henry II. it was granted to Henry Fitzherbert, but his claim
was afterwards resigned, and subsequently various Anglo-Norman
settlements were made. About 100,000 acres of the
estates of the earl of Desmond, which were forfeited in 1586,
were situated in the county, and other extensive confiscations
took place after the Cromwellian wars. In 1709 a German
colony from the Palatinate was settled by Lord Southwell near
Bruff, Rathkeale and Adare.</p>

<p>There are only slight remains of the round tower at Ardpatrick,
but that at Dysert is much better preserved; another at
Kilmallock is in great part a reconstruction. There are
important remains of stone circles, pillar stones and altars at
Loch Gur. In several places there are remains of old moats and
tumuli. Besides the monasteries in the city of Limerick, the
most important monastic ruins are those of Adare abbey,
Askeaton abbey, Galbally friary, Kilflin monastery, Kilmallock
and Monaster-Nenagh abbey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMERICK,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> a city, county of a city, parliamentary borough,
port and the chief town of Co. Limerick, Ireland, occupying
both banks and an island (King&rsquo;s Island) of the river Shannon,
at the head of its estuary, 129 m. W.S.W. of Dublin by the
Great Southern and Western railway. Pop. (1901) 38,151. The
situation is striking, for the Shannon is here a broad and noble
stream, and the immediately surrounding country consists of the
rich lowlands of its valley, while beyond rise the hills of the
counties Clare and Tipperary. The city is divided into English
Town (on King&rsquo;s Island), Irish Town and Newtown Pery, the first
including the ancient nucleus of the city, and the last the principal
modern streets. The main stream of the Shannon is crossed by
Thomond Bridge and Sarsfield or Wellesley Bridge. The first
is commanded by King John&rsquo;s Castle, on King&rsquo;s Island, a fine
Norman fortress fronting the river, and used as barracks. At
the west end of the bridge is preserved the Treaty Stone, on
which the Treaty of Limerick was signed in 1691. The cathedral
of St Mary, also on King&rsquo;s Island, was originally built in 1142-1180,
and exhibits some Early English work, though largely
altered at dates subsequent to that period. The Roman Catholic
cathedral of St John is a modern building (1860) in early pointed
style. The churches of St Munchin (to whom is attributed the
foundation of the see in the 6th century) and St John, Whitamore&rsquo;s
Castle and a Dominican priory, are other remains of
antiquarian interest; while the principal city and county
buildings are a chamber of commerce, a custom house commanding
the river, and court house, town hall and barracks. A
picturesque public park adjoins the railway station in Newtown
Pery.</p>

<p>The port is the most important on the west coast, and accommodates
vessels of 3000 tons in a floating dock; there is also a
graving dock. Communication with the Atlantic is open and
secure, while a vast network of inland navigation is opened up
by a canal avoiding the rapids above the city. Quays extend for
about 1600 yds. on each side of the river, and vessels of 600 tons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page695" id="page695"></a>695</span>
can moor alongside at spring tides. The principal imports are
grain, sugar, timber and coal. The exports consist mainly of
agricultural produce. The principal industrial establishments
include flour-mills (Limerick supplying most of the west of
Ireland with flour), factories for bacon-curing and for condensed
milk and creameries. Some brewing, distilling and tanning are
carried on, and the manufacture of very beautiful lace is maintained
at the Convent of the Good Shepherd; but a formerly
important textile industry has lapsed. The salmon fisheries of
the Shannon, for which Limerick is the headquarters of a district,
are the most valuable in Ireland. The city is governed by
a corporation, and the parliamentary borough returns one
member.</p>

<p>Limerick is said to have been the <i>Regia</i> of Ptolemy and the
<i>Rosse-de-Nailleagh</i> of the Annals of Multifernan. There is a
tradition that it was visited by St Patrick in the 5th century,
but it is first authentically known as a settlement of the Danes,
who sacked it in 812 and afterwards made it the principal town
of their kingdom of Limerick, but were expelled from it towards
the close of the 10th century by Brian Boroimhe. From 1106
till its conquest by the English in 1174 it was the seat of the kings
of Thomond or North Munster, and, although in 1179 the
kingdom of Limerick was given by Henry II. to Herbert Fitzherbert,
the city was frequently in the possession of the Irish
chieftains till 1195. Richard I. granted it a charter in 1197.
By King John it was committed to the care of William de Burgo,
who founded English Town, and for its defence erected a strong
castle. The city was frequently besieged in the 13th and 14th
centuries. In the 15th century its fortifications were extended
to include Irish Town, and until their demolition in 1760 it was
one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom. In 1651 it was
taken by General Ireton, and after an unsuccessful siege by
William III. in 1690 its resistance was terminated on the 3rd of
October of the following year by the treaty of Limerick. The
dismantling of its fortifications began in 1760, but fragments of
the old walls remain. The original municipal rights of the city
had been confirmed and extended by a succession of sovereigns,
and in 1609 it received a charter constituting it a county of a
city, and also incorporating a society of merchants of the staple,
with the same privileges as the merchants of the staple of Dublin
and Waterford. The powers of the corporation were remodelled
by the Limerick Regulation Act of 1823. The prosperity of the
city dates chiefly from the foundation of Newtown Pery in 1769
by Edmund Sexton Pery (d. 1806), speaker of the Irish House
of Commons, whose family subsequently received the title of the
earldom of Limerick. Under the Local Government Act of 1898
Limerick became one of the six county boroughs having a
separate county council.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMERICK,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> a name which has been adopted to distinguish
a certain form of verse which began to be cultivated in the middle
of the 19th century. A limerick is a kind of burlesque epigram,
written in five lines. In its earlier form it had two rhymes,
the word which closed the first or second line being usually
employed at the end of the fifth, but in later varieties different
rhyming words are employed. There is much uncertainty as
to the meaning of the name, and as to the time when it became
attached to a particular species of nonsense verses. According
to the <i>New Eng. Dict.</i> &ldquo;a song has existed in Ireland for a very
considerable time, the construction of the verse of which is
identical with that of Lear&rsquo;s&rdquo; (see below), and in which the
invitation is repeated, &ldquo;Will you come up to Limerick?&rdquo;
Unfortunately, the specimen quoted in the <i>New Eng. Dict.</i> is not
only not identical with, but does not resemble Lear&rsquo;s. Whatever
be the derivation of the name, however, it is now universally
used to describe a set of verses formed on this model, with the
variations in rhyme noted above:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;There was an old man who said &lsquo;Hush!</p>
<p class="i05">I perceive a young bird in that bush!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="i4">When they said, &lsquo;Is it small?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="i4">He replied, &lsquo;Not at all!</p>
<p class="i05">It is five times the size of the bush.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The invention, or at least the earliest general use of this form,
is attributed to Edward Lear, who, when a tutor in the family of
the earl of Derby at Knowsley, composed, about 1834, a large
number of nonsense-limericks to amuse the little grandchildren
of the house. Many of these he published, with illustrations,
in 1846, and they enjoyed and still enjoy an extreme popularity.
Lear preferred to give a geographical colour to his absurdities,
as in:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;There was an old person of Tartary</p>
<p class="i05">Who cut through his jugular artery,</p>
<p class="i4">When up came his wife,</p>
<p class="i4">And exclaimed, &lsquo;O my Life,</p>
<p class="i05">How your loss will be felt through all Tartary!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">but this is by no means essential. The neatness of the form has
led to a very extensive use of the limerick for all sorts of mock-serious
purposes, political, social and sarcastic, and a good many
specimens have achieved a popularity which has been all the
wider because they have, perforce, been confined to verbal
transmission. In recent years competitions of the &ldquo;missing
word&rdquo; type have had considerable vogue, the competitor, for
instance, having to supply the last line of the limerick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMES GERMANICUS.<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> The Latin noun <i>limes</i> denoted generally
a path, sometimes a boundary path (possibly its original
sense) or boundary, and hence it was utilized by Latin writers
occasionally to denote frontiers definitely delimited and marked
in some distinct fashion. This latter sense has been adapted
and extended by modern historians concerned with the frontiers
of the Roman Empire. Thus the Wall of Hadrian in north
England (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Britain</a></span>: <i>Roman</i>) is now sometimes styled the
<i>Limes Britannicus</i>, the frontier of the Roman province of
Arabia facing the desert the <i>Limes Arabicus</i> and so forth. In
particular the remarkable frontier lines which bounded the
Roman provinces of Upper (southern) Germany and Raetia,
and which at their greatest development stretched from near
Bonn on the Rhine to near Regensburg on the Danube, are often
called the <i>Limes Germanicus</i>. The history of these lines is the
subject of the following paragraphs. They have in the last
fifteen years become much better known through systematic
excavations financed by the German empire and through other
researches connected therewith, and though many important
details are still doubtful, their general development can be
traced.</p>

<p>From the death of Augustus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 14) till after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70 Rome
accepted as her German frontier the water-boundary of the
Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only
the fertile plain of Frankfort, opposite the Roman border fortress
of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black
Forest and a few scattered têtes-du-pont. The northern section
of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the
Roman boundary till the empire fell. The southern part was
different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily
crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long,
enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory&mdash;the modern
Baden and Württemberg. The German populations of these
lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman
subjects from the modern Alsace and Lorraine had drifted across
the river eastwards. The motives alike of geographical convenience
and of the advantages to be gained by recognizing these
movements of Roman subjects combined to urge a forward
policy at Rome, and when the vigorous Vespasian had succeeded
the fool-criminal Nero, a series of advances began which gradually
closed up the acute angle, or at least rendered it obtuse.</p>

<p>The first advance came about 74, when what is now Baden
was invaded and in part annexed and a road carried from the
Roman base on the upper Rhine, Strassburg, to the Danube
just above Ulm. The point of the angle was broken off. The
second advance was made by Domitian about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 83. He
pushed out from Moguntiacum, extended the Roman territory
east of it and enclosed the whole within a systematically delimited
and defended frontier with numerous blockhouses along
it and larger forts in the rear. Among the blockhouses was one
which by various enlargements and refoundations grew into the
well-known Saalburg fort on the Taunus near Homburg. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page696" id="page696"></a>696</span>
advance necessitated a third movement, the construction of a
frontier connecting the annexations of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 74 and 83. We
know the line of this frontier which ran from the Main across
the upland Odenwald to the upper waters of the Neckar and was
defended by a chain of forts. We do not, however, know its
date, save that, if not Domitian&rsquo;s work, it was carried out soon
after his death, and the whole frontier thus constituted was
reorganized, probably by Hadrian, with a continuous wooden
palisade reaching from Rhine to Danube. The angle between
the rivers was now almost full. But there remained further
advance and further fortification. Either Hadrian or, more
probably, his successor Pius pushed out from the Odenwald and
the Danube, and marked out a new frontier roughly parallel to
but in advance of these two lines, though sometimes, as on the
Taunus, coinciding with the older line. This is the frontier
which is now visible and visited by the curious. It consists,
as we see it to-day, of two distinct frontier works, one, known
as the Pfahlgraben, is an earthen mound and ditch, best seen
in the neighbourhood of the Saalburg but once extending from
the Rhine southwards into southern Germany. The other,
which begins where the earthwork stops, is a wall, though not
a very formidable wall, of stone, the Teufelsmauer; it runs
roughly east and west parallel to the Danube, which it finally
joins at Heinheim near Regensburg. The Pfahlgraben is remarkable
for the extraordinary directness of its southern part, which
for over 50 m. runs mathematically straight and points almost
absolutely true for the Polar star. It is a clear case of an ancient
frontier laid out in American fashion. This frontier remained
for about 100 years, and no doubt in that long period much was
done to it to which we cannot affix precise dates. We cannot
even be absolutely certain when the frontier laid out by Pius
was equipped with the Pfahlgraben and Teufelsmauer. But
we know that the pressure of the barbarians began to be felt
seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long
struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of Rhine
and north of Danube was lost&mdash;seemingly all within one short
period&mdash;about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 250.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMESTONE,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> in petrography, a rock consisting essentially of
carbonate of lime. The group includes many varieties, some of
which are very distinct; but the whole group has certain
properties in common, arising from the chemical composition
and mineral character of its members. All limestones dissolve
readily in cold dilute acids, giving off bubbles of carbonic acid.
Citric or acetic acid will effect this change, though the mineral
acids are more commonly employed. Limestones, when pure,
are soft rocks readily scratched with a knife-blade or the edge
of a coin, their hardness being 3; but unless they are earthy or
incoherent, like chalk or sinter, they do not disintegrate by
pressure with the fingers and cannot be scratched with the finger
nail. When free from impurities limestones are white, but they
generally contain small quantities of other minerals than calcite
which affect their colour. Many limestones are yellowish or
creamy, especially those which contain a little iron oxide, iron
carbonate or clay. Others are bluish from the presence of iron
sulphide, or pyrites or marcasite; or grey and black from
admixture with carbonaceous or bituminous substances. Red
limestones usually contain haematite; in green limestones
there may be glauconite or chlorite. In crystalline limestones
or marbles many silicates may occur producing varied colours,
<i>e.g.</i> epidote, chlorite, augite (green); vesuvianite and garnet
(brown and red); graphite, spinels (black and grey); epidote,
chondrodite (yellow). The specific gravity of limestones ranges
from 2.6 to 2.8 in typical examples.</p>

<p>When seen in the field, limestones are often recognizable
by their method of weathering. If very pure, they may have
smooth rounded surfaces, or may be covered with narrow runnels
cut out by the rain. In such cases there is very little soil, and
plants are found growing only in fissures or crevices where the
insoluble impurities of the limestone have been deposited by the
rain. The less pure rocks have often eroded or pitted surfaces,
showing bands or patches rendered more resistant to the action
of the weather by the presence of insoluble materials such as
sand, clay or chert. These surfaces are often known from the
crust of hydrous oxides of iron produced by the action of the
atmosphere on any ferriferous ingredients of the rock; they are
sometimes black when the limestone is carbonaceous; a thin
layer of gritty sand grains may be left on the surface of limestones
which are slightly arenaceous. Most limestones which contain
fossils show these most clearly on weathered surfaces, and the
appearance of fragments of corals, crinoids and shells on the
exposed parts of a rock indicate a strong probability that
that rock is a limestone. The interior usually shows the organic
structures very imperfectly or not at all.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of pure limestones, where they occur
in large masses occupying considerable areas, is the frequency
with which they produce bare rocky ground, especially at high
elevations, or yield only a thin scanty soil covered with short
grass. In mountainous districts limestones are often recognizable
by these peculiarities. The chalk downs are celebrated for the
close green sward which they furnish. More impure limestones,
like those of the Lias and Oolites, contain enough insoluble
mineral matter to yield soils of great thickness and value, <i>e.g.</i>
the Cornbrash. In limestone regions all waters tend to be hard,
on account of the abundant carbonate of lime dissolved by
percolating waters, and caves, swallow holes, sinks, pot-holes
and underground rivers may occur in abundance. Some elevated
tracts of limestone are very barren (<i>e.g.</i> the Causses), because
the rain which falls in them sinks at once into the earth and
passes underground. To a large extent this is true of the chalk
downs, where surface waters are notably scarce, though at considerable
depths the rocks hold large supplies of water.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The great majority of limestones are of organic formation, consisting
of the debris of the skeletons of animals. Some are foraminiferal,
others are crinoidal, shelly or coral limestones according
to the nature of the creatures whose remains they contain. Of
foraminiferal limestones chalk is probably the best known; it is
fine, white and rather soft, and is very largely made up of the
shells of globigerina and other foraminifera (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chalk</a></span>). Almost
equally important are the nummulitic limestones so well developed
in Mediterranean countries (Spain, France, the Alps, Greece, Algeria,
Egypt, Asia Minor, &amp;c.). The pyramids of Egypt are built mainly
of nummulitic limestone. Nummulites are large cone-shaped foraminifera
with many chambers arranged in spiral order. In Britain
the small globular shells of <i>Saccamina</i> are important constituents of
some Carboniferous limestones; but the upper portion of that
formation in Russia, eastern Asia and North America is characterized
by the occurrence of limestones filled with the spindle-shaped shells
of <i>Fusulina</i>, a genus of foraminifera now extinct.</p>

<p>Coral limestones are being formed at the present day over a
large extent of the tropical seas; many existing coral reefs must
be of great thickness. The same process has been going on actively
since a very early period of the earth&rsquo;s history, for similar rocks are
found in great abundance in many geological formations. Some
Silurian limestones are rich in corals; in the Devonian there are
deposits which have been described as coral reefs (Devonshire,
Germany). The Carboniferous limestone, or mountain limestones
of England and North America, is sometimes nearly entirely coralline,
and the great dolomite masses of the Trias in the eastern Alps are
believed by many to be merely altered coral reefs. A special feature
of coral limestones is that, although they may be to a considerable
extent dolomitized, they are generally very free from silt and
mechanical impurities.</p>

<p>Crinoidal limestones, though abundant among the older rocks,
are not in course of formation on any great scale at the present
time, as crinoids, formerly abundant, are now rare. Many Carboniferous
and Silurian limestones consist mainly of the little cylindrical
joints of these animals. They are easily recognized by their shape,
and by the fact that many of them show a tube along their axes,
which is often filled up by carbonate of lime; under the microscope
they have a punctate or fenestrate structure and each joint behaves
as a simple crystalline plate with uniform optical properties in
polarized light. Remains of other echinoderms (starfishes and sea
urchins) are often found in plenty in Secondary and Tertiary limestones,
but very seldom make up the greater part of the rock.
Shelly limestones may consist of mollusca or of brachiopoda, the
former being common in limestones of all ages while the latter attained
their principal development in the Palaeozoic epoch. The shells
are often broken and may have been reduced to shell sand before
the rock consolidated. Many rocks of this class are impure and pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page697" id="page697"></a>697</span>
into marls and shelly sandstones which were deposited in shallow
waters, where land-derived sediment mingled with remains of the
creatures which inhabited the water. Fresh-water limestones are
mostly of this class and contain shells of those varieties of mollusca
which inhabit lakes. Brackish water limestones also are usually
shelly. Corallines (bryozoa, polyzoa, &amp;c.), cephalopods (<i>e.g.</i> ammonites,
belemnites), crustaceans and sponges occur frequently in
limestones. It should be understood that it is not usual for a
rock to be built up entirely of one kind of organism though it is
classified according to its most abundant or most conspicuous
ingredients.</p>

<p>In the organic limestones there usually occurs much finely granular
calcareous matter which has been described as limestone mud or
limestone paste. It is the finely ground substance which results
from the breaking down of shells, &amp;c., by the waves and currents,
and by the decay which takes place in the sea bottom before the
fragments are compacted into hard rock. The skeletal parts of
marine animals are not always converted into limestone in the
place where they were formed. In shallow waters, such as are the
favourite haunts of mollusca, corals, &amp;c., the tides and storms are
frequently sufficiently powerful to shift the loose material on the sea
bottom. A large part of a coral reef consists of broken coral rock
dislodged from the growing mass and carried upwards to the beach
or into the lagoon. Large fragments also fall over the steep outward
slopes of the reef and build up a talus at their base. Coral muds and
coral sands produced by the waves acting in these detached blocks,
are believed to cover two and a half millions of square miles of the
ocean floor. Owing to the fragile nature of the shells of foraminifera
they readily become disintegrated, especially at considerable depths,
largely by the solvent action of carbonic acid in sea water as they
sink to the bottom. The chalk in very great part consists not of
entire shells but of debris of foraminifera, and mollusca (such as
<i>Inoceramus</i>, &amp;c.). The Globigerina ooze is the most widespread of
modern calcareous formations. It occupies nearly fifty millions
of square miles of the sea bottom, at an average depth of two thousand
fathoms. Pteropod ooze, consisting mainly of the shells of
pteropods (mollusca) also has a wide distribution, especially in
northern latitudes.</p>

<p>Consolidation may to a considerable extent be produced by
pressure, but more commonly cementation and crystallization play
a large part in the process. Recent shell sands on beaches and in
dunes are not unfrequently converted into a soft, semi-coherent
rock by rain water filtering downwards, dissolving and redepositing
carbonate of lime between the sand grains. In coral reefs also the
mass soon has its cavities more or less obliterated by a deposit of
calcite from solution. The fine interstitial mud or paste presents
a large surface to the solvents, and is more readily attacked than the
larger and more compact shell fragments. In fresh-water marls
considerable masses of crystalline calcite may be produced in this
way, enclosing well-preserved molluscan shells. Many calcareous
fragments consist of aragonite, wholly or principally, and this mineral
tends to be replaced by calcite. The aragonite, as seen in sections
under the microscope, is usually fibrous or prismatic, the calcite is
more commonly granular with a well-marked network of rhombohedral
cleavage cracks. The replacement of aragonite by calcite goes on
even in shells lying on modern sea shores, and is often very complete
in rocks belonging to the older geological periods. By the recrystallization
of the finer paste and the introduction of calcite in
solution the interior of shells, corals, foraminifera, &amp;c., becomes
occupied by crystalline calcite, sometimes in comparatively large
grains, while the original organic structures may be very well-preserved.</p>

<p>Some limestones are exceedingly pure, <i>e.g.</i> the chalk and some
varieties of mountain limestone, and these are especially suited for
making lime. The majority, however, contain admixture of other
substances, of which the commonest are clay and sand. Clayey or
argillaceous limestones frequently occur in thin or thick beds alternating
with shales, as in the Lias of England (the marlstone series).
Friable argillaceous fresh-water limestones are called &ldquo;marls,&rdquo;
and are used in many districts for top dressing soils, but the name
&ldquo;marl&rdquo; is loosely applied and is often given to beds which are
not of this nature (<i>e.g.</i> the red marls of the Trias). The &ldquo;cement
stones&rdquo; of the Lothians in Scotland are argillaceous limestones of
Lower Carboniferous age, which when burnt yield cement. The gault
(Upper Cretaceous) is a calcareous clay, often containing well-preserved
fossils, which lies below the chalk and attains considerable
importance in the south-east of England. Arenaceous limestones
pass by gradual transitions into shelly sandstones; in the latter the
shells are often dissolved leaving cavities, which may be occupied
by casts. Some of the Old Red Sandstone is calcareous. In other
cases the calcareous matter has recrystallized in large plates which
have shining cleavage surfaces dotted over with grains of sand
(Lincolnshire limestone). The Fontainebleau sandstone has large
calcite rhombohedra filled with sand grains. Limestones sometimes
contain much plant matter which has been converted into a dark
coaly substance, in which the original woody structures may be
preserved or may not. The calcareous petrified plants of Fifeshire
occur in such a limestone, and much has been learned from a microscopic
study of them regarding the anatomy of the plants of the
Carboniferous period. Volcanic ashes occur in some limestones, a
good example being the calcareous schalsteins or tuffs of Devonshire,
which are usually much crushed by earth movements. In the
Globigerina ooze of the present day there is always a slight admixture
of volcanic materials derived either from wind-blown dust, from
submarine eruptions or from floating pieces of pumice. Other
limestones contain organic matter in the shape of asphalt, bitumen
or petroleum, presumably derived from plant remains. The well-known
<i>Val de Travers</i> is a bituminous limestone of lower Neocomian
age found in the valley of that name near Neuchâtel. Some of the
oil beds of North America are porous limestones, in the cavities of
which the oil is stored up. Siliceous limestones, where their silica
is original and of organic origin, have contained skeletons of sponges
or radiolaria. In the chalk the silica has usually been dissolved and
redeposited as flint nodules, and in the Carboniferous limestone as
chert bands. It may also be deposited in the corals and other
organic remains, silicifying them, with preservation of the original
structures (<i>e.g.</i> some Jurassic and Carboniferous limestones).</p>

<p>The oolitic limestones form a special group distinguished by their
consisting of small rounded or elliptical grains resembling fish roe;
when coarse they are called pisolites. Many of them are very pure
and highly fossiliferous. The oolitic grains in section may have a
nucleus, <i>e.g.</i> a fragment of a shell, quartz grain, &amp;c., around which
concentric layers have been deposited. In many cases there is also
a radiating structure. They consist of calcite or aragonite, and
between the grains there is usually a cementing material of limestone
mud or granular calcite crystals. Deposits of silica, carbonate
of iron or small rhombohedra of dolomite are often found in the
interior of the spheroids, and oolites may be entirely silicified
(Pennsylvania, Cambrian rocks of Scotland). Oolitic ironstones are
very abundant in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire and form an
important iron ore. They are often impure, and their iron may be
present as haematite or as chalybite. Oolitic limestones are known
from many geological formations, <i>e.g.</i> the Cambrian and Silurian of
Scotland and Wales, Carboniferous limestone (Bristol), Jurassic,
Tertiary and Recent limestones. They are forming at the present
day in some coral reefs and in certain petrifying springs like those
of Carlsbad. Their chief development in England is in the Jurassic
rocks where they occur in large masses excellently adapted for
building purposes, and yield the well-known freestones of Portland
and Bath. Some hold that they are chemical precipitates and that
the concentric oolitic structure is produced by successive layers of
calcareous deposit laid down on fragments of shells, &amp;c., in highly
calcareous waters. An alternative hypothesis is that minute
cellular plants (<i>Girvanella</i>, &amp;c.), have extracted the carbonate of
lime from the water, and have been the principal agents in producing
the successive calcareous crusts. Such plants can live even in hot
waters, and there seems much reason for regarding them as of
importance in this connexion.</p>

<p>Another group of limestones is of inorganic or chemical origin,
having been deposited from solution in water without the intervention
of living organisms. A good example of these is the
&ldquo;stalactite&rdquo; which forms pendent masses on the roofs of caves in
limestone districts, the calcareous waters exposed to evaporation
in the air of the cave laying down successive layers of stalactite in
the places from which they drip. At the same time and in the
same way &ldquo;stalagmite&rdquo; gathers on the floor below, and often
accumulates in thick masses which contain bones of animals and the
weapons of primitive cave-dwelling man. Calc sinters are porous
limestones deposited by the evaporation of calcareous springs;
travertine is a well-known Italian rock of this kind. At Carlsbad
oolitic limestones are forming, but it seems probable that minute
algae assist in this process. Chemical deposits of carbonate of lime
may be produced by the evaporation of sea water in some upraised
coral lagoons and similar situations, but it is unlikely that this
takes place to any extent in the open sea, as sea water contains
very little carbonate of lime, apparently because marine organisms
so readily abstract it; still some writers believe that a considerable
part of the chalk is really a chemical precipitate. Onyx marbles
are banded limestones of chemical origin with variegated colours
such as white, yellow, green and red. They are used for ornamental
work and are obtained in Persia, France, the United States,
Mexico, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Limestones are exceedingly susceptible to chemical changes of a
metasomatic kind. They are readily dissolved by carbonated waters
and acid solutions, and their place may then be occupied by deposits
of a different kind. The silification of oolites and coral rocks and
their replacement by iron ores above mentioned are examples of
this process. Many extensive hematite deposits are in this way
formed in limestone districts. Phosphatization sometimes takes
place, amorphous phosphate of lime being substituted for carbonate
of lime, and these replacement products often have great value as
sources of natural fertilizers. On ocean rocks in dry climates the
droppings of birds (guano) which contain much phosphate, percolating
into the underlying limestones change them into a hard white
or yellow phosphate rock (<i>e.g.</i> Sombrero, Christmas Island, &amp;c.),
sometimes known as rock-guano or mineral guano. In the north
of France beds of phosphate are found in the chalk; they occur
also in England on a smaller scale. All limestones, especially those
laid down in deep waters contain some lime phosphate, derived from
shells of certain brachiopods, fish bones, teeth, whale bones, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page698" id="page698"></a>698</span>
and this may pass into solution and be redeposited in certain horizons,
a process resembling the formation of flints. On the sea bottom at
the present day phosphatic nodules are found which have gathered
round the dead bodies of fishes and other animals. As in flint the
organic structures of the original limestone may be well preserved
though the whole mass is phosphatized.</p>

<p>Where uprising heated waters carrying mineral solutions are
proceeding from deep seated masses of igneous rocks they often
deposit a portion of their contents in limestone beds. At Leadville,
in Colorado, for example, great quantities of rich silver lead ore,
which have yielded not a little gold, have been obtained from the
limestones, while other rocks, though apparently equally favourably
situated, are barren. The lead and fluorspar deposits of the north
of England (Alston Moor, Derbyshire) occur in limestone. In the
Malay States the limestones have been impregnated with tin oxide.
Zinc ores are very frequently associated with beds of limestone, as
at Vieille Montagne in Belgium, and copper ores are found in great
quantity in Arizona in rocks of this kind. Apart from ore deposits
of economic value a great number of different minerals, often well
crystallized, have been observed in limestones.</p>

<p>When limestones occur among metamorphic schists or in the
vicinity of intrusive plutonic masses (such as granite), they are usually
recrystallized and have lost their organic structures. They are then
known as crystalline limestones or marbles (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMINA APOSTOLORUM,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> an ecclesiastical term used to denote
Rome, and especially the church of St Peter and St Paul. A
<i>Visitatio Liminum</i> might be undertaken <i>ex voto</i> or <i>ex lege</i>. The
former, visits paid in accordance with a vow, were very frequent
in the middle ages, and were under the special protection of the
pope, who put the ban upon any who should molest pilgrims
&ldquo;who go to Rome for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; The question of granting
dispensations from such a vow gave rise to much canonical
legislation, in which the papacy had finally to give in to the
bishops. The visits demanded by law were of more importance.
In 743 a Roman synod decreed that all bishops subject to the
metropolitan see of Rome should meet personally every year in
that city to give an account of the state of their dioceses.
Gregory VII. included in the order all metropolitans of the
Western Church, and Sixtus V. (by the bull <i>Romanus Pontifex</i>,
Dec. 20, 1584) ordered the bishops of Italy, Dalmatia and
Greece to visit Rome every three years; those of France, Germany,
Spain and Portugal, Belgium, Hungary, Bohemia and the
British Isles every four years; those from the rest of Europe
every five years; and bishops from other continents every ten
years. Benedict XIV. in 1740 extended the summons to all
abbots, provosts and others who held territorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMITATION, STATUTES OF,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> the name given to acts of
parliament by which rights of action are limited in the United
Kingdom to a fixed period after the occurrence of the events
giving rise to the cause of action. This is one of the devices by
which lapse of time is employed to settle disputed claims. There
are mainly two modes by which this may be effected. We may
say that the active enjoyment of a right&mdash;or possession&mdash;for a
determined period shall be a good title against all the world.
That is the method known generally as Prescription (<i>q.v.</i>).
It looks to the length of time during which the defendant in a
disputed claim has been in possession or enjoyment of the matter
in dispute. But the principle of the statutes of limitation is to
look to the length of time during which the plaintiff has been out
of possession. The point of time at which he might first have
brought his action having been ascertained, the lapse of the
limited period after that time bars him for ever from bringing his
action. In both cases the policy of the law is expressed by the
maxim <i>Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium</i>.</p>

<p>The principle of limitation was first adopted in English law in
connexion with real actions, <i>i.e.</i> actions for the recovery of real
property. At first a fixed date was taken, and no action could
be brought of which the cause had arisen before that date. By
the Statute of Westminster the First (3 Edward I. c. 39), the
beginning of the reign of Richard I. was fixed as the date of
limitation for such actions. This is the well-known &ldquo;period of
legal memory&rdquo; recognized by the judges in a different class of
cases to which a rule of prescription was applied. Possession
of rights in <i>alieno solo</i> from time immemorial was held to be an
indefeasible title, and the courts held time immemorial to begin
with the first year of Richard I.</p>

<p>A period absolutely fixed became in time useless for the
purposes of limitation, and the method of counting back a
certain number of years from the date of the writs was adopted
in the Statute 32 Henry VIII. c. 2, which fixed periods of thirty,
fifty and sixty years for various classes of actions named therein.
A large number of statutes since that time have established
periods of limitation for different kinds of actions. Of those
now in force the most important are the Limitation Act 1623
for personal actions in general, and the Real Property Limitation
Act 1833 relating to actions for the recovery of land. The
latter statute has been repealed and virtually re-enacted by the
Real Property Limitation Act 1874, which reduced the period of
limitation from twenty years to twelve, for all actions brought
after the 1st January 1879. The principal section of the act of
1833 will show the <i>modus operandi</i>: &ldquo;After the 31st December
1833, no person shall make an entry or distress, or bring an
action to recover any land or rent <i>but within twenty years next
after the time</i> at which the right to make such entry or distress
or to bring such action shall have first accrued to some person
through whom he claims, or shall have first accrued to the person
making or bringing the same.&rdquo; Another section defines the times
at which the right of action or entry shall be deemed to have
accrued in particular cases; <i>e.g.</i> when the estate claimed shall
have been an estate or interest in reversion, such right shall be
deemed to have first accrued at the time at which such estate or
interest became an estate or interest in possession. Thus suppose
lands to be let by A to B from 1830 for a period of fifty years,
and that a portion of such lands is occupied by C from 1831
without any colour of title from B or A&mdash;C&rsquo;s long possession
would be of no avail against an action brought by A for the
recovery of the land after the determination of B&rsquo;s lease. A
would have twelve years after the determination of the lease
within which to bring his action, and might thus, by an action
brought in 1891, disestablish a person who had been in quiet
possession since 1831. What the law looks to is not the length
of time during which C has enjoyed the property, but the length
of time which A has suffered to elapse since he might first have
brought his action. It is to be observed, however, that the
Real Property Limitation Act does more than bar the remedy.
It extinguishes the right, differing in this respect from the other
Limitation Acts, which, while barring the remedy, preserve the
right, so that it may possibly become available in some other way
than by action.</p>

<p>By section 14 of the act of 1833, when any acknowledgment
of the title of the person entitled shall have been given to him
or his agent in writing signed by the person in possession, or
in receipt of the profits or rent, then the right of the person (to
whom such acknowledgment shall have been given) to make an
entry or distress or bring an action shall be deemed to have first
accrued at the time at which such acknowledgment, or the last
of such acknowledgments, was given. By section 15, persons
under the disability of infancy, lunacy or coverture, or beyond
seas, and their representatives, are to be allowed ten years from
the termination of this disability, or death (which shall have first
happened), notwithstanding that the ordinary period of limitation
shall have expired.</p>

<p>By the act of 1623 actions of trespass, detinue, trover, replevin
or account, actions on the case (except for slander), actions of debt
arising out of a simple contract and actions for arrears of rent
not due upon specialty shall be limited to six years from the
date of the cause of action. Actions for assault, menace, battery,
wounds and imprisonment are limited to four years, and actions
for slander to two years. Persons labouring under the disabilities
of infancy, lunacy or unsoundness of mind are allowed
the same time after the removal of the disability. When the
defendant was &ldquo;beyond seas&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> outside the United Kingdom
and the adjacent islands) an extension of time was allowed, but
by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1874 such an allowance
is excluded as to real property, and as to other matters by the
Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856.</p>

<p>An acknowledgment, whether by payment on account or by
mere spoken words, was formerly sufficient to take the case out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page699" id="page699"></a>699</span>
of the statute. The Act 9 Geo. IV. c. 14 (Lord Tenterden&rsquo;s act)
requires any promise or admission of liability to be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged, otherwise it will not bar
the statute.</p>

<p>Contracts under seal are governed as to limitation by the act
of 1883, which provides that actions for rent upon any indenture
of demise, or of covenant, or debt or any bond or other specialty,
and on recognizances, must be brought within twenty years
after cause of action. Actions of debt on an award (the submission
being not under seal), or for a copyhold fine, or for
money levied on a writ of <i>fieri facias</i>, must be brought within six
years. With regard to the rights of the crown, the principle
obtains that <i>nullum tempus occurrit regi</i>, so that no statute of
limitation affects the crown without express mention. But by
the Crown Suits Act 1769, as amended by the Crown Suits Act
1861, in suits relating to land, the claims of the crown to recover
are barred after the lapse of sixty years. For the prosecution
of criminal offences generally there is no period of limitation,
except where they are punishable on summary conviction. In
such case the period is six months by the Summary Jurisdiction
Act 1848. But there are various miscellaneous limitations fixed
by various acts, of which the following may be noticed. Suits
and indictments under penal statutes are limited to two years
if the forfeiture is to the crown, to one year if the forfeiture is
to the common informer. Penal actions by persons aggrieved
are limited to two years by the act of 1833. Prosecutions under
the Riot Act can only be sued upon within twelve months after
the offence has been committed, and offences against the Customs
Acts within three years. By the Public Authorities Protection
Act 1893, a prosecution against any person acting in execution
of statutory or other public duty must be commenced within
six months. Prosecutions under the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, as amended by the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act
1904, must be commenced within six months after the commission
of the offence.</p>

<p>Trustees are expressly empowered to plead statutes of limitation
by the Trustees Act 1888; indeed, a defence under the
statutes of limitations must in general be specially pleaded.
Limitation is regarded strictly as a law of procedure. The
English courts will therefore apply their own rules to all actions,
although the cause of action may have arisen in a country in
which different rules of limitation exist. This is also a recognized
principle of private international law (see J. A. Foote, <i>Private
International Law</i>, 3rd ed., 1904, p. 516 seq.).</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The principle of the statute of limitations has
passed with some modification into the statute-books of every
state in the Union except Louisiana, whose laws of limitation
are essentially the prescriptions of the civil law drawn from the
<i>Partidas</i>, or &ldquo;Spanish Code.&rdquo; As to personal actions, it is
generally provided that they shall be brought within a certain
specified time&mdash;usually six years or less&mdash;from the time when the
cause of action accrues, and not after, while for land the &ldquo;general
if not universal limitation of the right to bring action or to make
entry is to twenty years after the right to enter or to bring the
action accrues&rdquo; (Bouvier&rsquo;s <i>Law Dictionary</i>, art. &ldquo;Limitations&rdquo;).
The constitutional provision prohibiting states from passing laws
impairing the obligation of contracts is not infringed by a law
of limitations, unless it bars a right of action already accrued
without giving a reasonable term within which to bring the action.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMOGES,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a town of west-central France, capital of the
department of Haute-Vienne, formerly capital of the old province
of Limousin, 176 m. S. by W. of Orleans on the railway to
Toulouse. Pop. (1906) town, 75,906; commune, 88,597.
The station is a junction for Poitiers, Angoulême, Périgueux
and Clermont-Ferrand. The town occupies a hill on the right
bank of the Vienne, and comprises two parts originally distinct,
the <i>Cité</i> with narrow streets and old houses occupying the lower
slope, and the town proper the summit. In the latter a street
known as the Rue de la Boucherie is occupied by a powerful and
ancient corporation of butchers. The site of the fortifications
which formerly surrounded both quarters is occupied by boulevards,
outside which are suburbs with wide streets and spacious
squares. The cathedral, the most remarkable building in the
Limousin, was begun in 1273. In 1327 the choir was completed,
and before the middle of the 16th century the transept, with its
fine north portal and the first two bays of the nave; from 1875
to 1890 the construction of the nave was continued, and it was
united with the west tower (203 ft. high), the base of which
belongs to a previous Romanesque church. In the interior
there are a magnificent rood loft of the Renaissance, and the
tombs of Jean de Langeac (d. 1541) and other bishops. Of the
other churches of Limoges, St Michel des Lions (14th and 15th
centuries) and St Pierre du Queyroix (12th and 13th centuries)
both contain interesting stained glass. The principal modern
buildings are the town hall and the law-courts. The Vienne is
crossed by a railway viaduct and four bridges, two of which,
the Pont St Étienne and the Pont St Martial, date from the
13th century. Among the chief squares are the Place d&rsquo;Orsay
on the site of a Roman amphitheatre, the Place Jourdan with
the statue of Marshal J. B. Jourdan, born at Limoges, and the
Place d&rsquo;Aine with the statue of J. L. Gay-Lussac. President
Carnot and Denis Dussoubs, both of whom have statues, were
also natives of the town. The museum has a rich ceramic
collection and art, numismatic and natural history collections.</p>

<p>Limoges is the headquarters of the XII. army corps and the
seat of a bishop, a prefect, a court of appeal and a court of
assizes, and has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a
board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce and a branch
of the Bank of France. The educational institutions include
a <i>lycée</i> for boys, a preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy,
a higher theological seminary, a training college, a national
school of decorative art and a commercial and industrial school.
The manufacture and decoration of porcelain give employment
to about 13,000 persons in the town and its vicinity. Shoe-making
and the manufacture of clogs occupy over 2000. Other
industries are liqueur-distilling, the spinning of wool and cloth-weaving,
printing and the manufacture of paper from straw.
Enamelling, which flourished at Limoges in the middle ages and
during the Renaissance (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Enamel</a></span>), but subsequently died out,
was revived at the end of the 19th century. There is an extensive
trade in wine and spirits, cattle, cereals and wood. The Vienne is
navigable for rafts above Limoges, and the logs brought down by
the current are stopped at the entrance of the town by the
inhabitants of the Naveix quarter, who form a special gild for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Limoges was a place of importance at the time of the Roman
conquest, and sent a large force to the defence of Alesia. In
11 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it took the name of Augustus (<i>Augustoritum</i>); but in
the 4th century it was anew called by the name of the <i>Lemovices</i>,
whose capital it was. It then contained palaces and baths, had
its own senate and the right of coinage. Christianity was introduced
by St Martial. In the 5th century Limoges was devastated
by the Vandals and the Visigoths, and afterwards suffered in the
wars between the Franks and Aquitanians and in the invasions
of the Normans. Under the Merovingian kings Limoges was
celebrated for its mints and its goldsmiths&rsquo; work. In the middle
ages the town was divided into two distinct parts, each surrounded
by walls, forming separate fiefs with a separate system of
administration, an arrangement which survived till 1792. Of
these the more important, known as the <i>Château</i>, which grew up
round the tomb of St Martial in the 9th century, and was surrounded
with walls in the 10th and again in the 12th, was under
the jurisdiction of the viscounts of Limoges, and contained their
castle and the monastery of St Martial; the other, the <i>Cité</i>,
which was under the jurisdiction of the bishop, had but a sparse
population, the habitable ground being practically covered by
the cathedral, the episcopal palace and other churches and
religious buildings. In the Hundred Years&rsquo; War the bishops sided
with the French, while the viscounts were unwilling vassals of
the English. In 1370 the <i>Cité</i>, which had opened its gates to the
French, was taken by the Black Prince and given over to fire
and sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page700" id="page700"></a>700</span></p>

<p>The religious wars, pestilence and famine desolated Limoges
in turn, and the plague of 1630-1631 carried off more than
20,000 persons. The wise administrations of Henri d&rsquo;Aguesseau,
father of the chancellor, and of Turgot enabled Limoges to
recover its former prosperity. There have been several great
fires, destroying whole quarters of the city, built, as it then was,
of wood. That of 1790 lasted for two months, and destroyed
192 houses; and that of 1864 laid under ashes a large area.
Limoges celebrates every seven years a curious religious festival
(Fête d&rsquo;Ostension), during which the relics of St Martial are
exposed for seven weeks, attracting large numbers of visitors.
It dates from the 10th century, and commemorates a pestilence
(mal des ardents) which, after destroying 40,000 persons, is
believed to have been stayed by the intercession of the saint.</p>

<p>Limoges was the scene of two ecclesiastical councils, in 1029
and 1031. The first proclaimed the title of St Martial as &ldquo;apostle
of Aquitaine&rdquo;; the second insisted on the observance of the
&ldquo;truce of God.&rdquo; In 1095 Pope Urban II. held a synod of
bishops here in connexion with his efforts to organize a crusade,
and on this occasion consecrated the basilica of St Martial
(pulled down after 1794).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMON,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Port Limon</span>, the chief Atlantic port of Costa Rica,
Central America, and the capital of a district also named Limon,
on a bay of the Caribbean Sea, 103 m. E. by N. of San José.
Pop. (1904) 3171. Limon was founded in 1871, and is the
terminus of the transcontinental railway to Puntarenas which
was begun in the same year. The swamps behind the town,
and the shallow coral lagoon in front of it, have been filled in.
The harbour is protected by a sea-wall built along the low-water
line, and an iron pier affords accommodation for large vessels.
A breakwater from the harbour to the island of Uvita, about
1200 yds. E. would render Limon a first-class port. There is
an excellent water-supply from the hills above the harbour.
Almost the entire coffee and banana crops of Costa Rica are sent
by rail for shipment at Limon to Europe and the United States.
The district (<i>comarca</i>) of Limon comprises the whole Atlantic
littoral, thus including the Talamanca country inhabited by
uncivilized Indians; the richest banana-growing territories in
the country; and the valuable forests of the San Juan valley.
It is annually visited by Indians from the Mosquito coast of
Nicaragua, who come in canoes to fish for turtle. Its chief towns,
after Limon, are Reventazon and Matina, both with <span class="correction" title="amended from fever">fewer</span> than
3000 inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMONITE,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Brown Iron Ore</span>, a natural ferric hydrate
named from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="leimôn">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#974;&#957;</span> (meadow), in allusion to its occurrence
as &ldquo;bog-ore&rdquo; in meadows and marshes. It is never crystallized,
but may have a fibrous or microcrystalline structure, and
commonly occurs in concretionary forms or in compact and
earthy masses; sometimes mammillated, botryoidal, reniform
or stalactitic. The colour presents various shades of brown and
yellow, and the streak is always brownish, a character which
distinguishes it from haematite with a red, or from magnetite
with a black streak. It is sometimes called brown haematite.</p>

<p>Limonite is a ferric hydrate, conforming typically with the
formula Fe<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">3</span>(OH)<span class="su">6</span>, or 2Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·3H<span class="su">2</span>O. Its hardness is rather
above 5, and its specific gravity varies from 3.5 to 4. In many
cases it has been formed from other iron oxides, like haematite
and magnetite, or by the alteration of pyrites or chalybite.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>By the operation of meteoric agencies, iron pyrites readily pass
into limonite often with retention of external form; and the masses
of &ldquo;gozzan&rdquo; or &ldquo;gossan&rdquo; on the outcrop of certain mineral-veins
consist of rusty iron ore formed in this way, and associated with
cellular quartz. Many deposits of limonite have been found, on
being worked, to pass downwards into ferrous carbonate; and
crystals of chalybite converted superficially into limonite are well
known. Minerals, like glauconite, which contain ferrous silicate,
may in like manner yield limonite, on weathering. The ferric
hydrate is also readily deposited from ferruginous waters, often
by means of organic agencies. Deposits of brown iron ore of great
economic value occur in many sedimentary rocks, such as the
Lias, Oolites and Lower Greensand of various parts of England.
They appear in some cases to be altered limestones and in others
altered glauconitic sandstones. An oolitic structure is sometimes
present, and the ores are generally phosphatic, and may contain
perhaps 30% of iron. The oolitic brown ores of Lorraine and
Luxemburg are known as &ldquo;minette,&rdquo; a diminutive of the French
<i>mine</i> (ore), in allusion to their low content of metal. Granular and
concretionary limonite accumulates by organic action on the floor
of certain lakes in Sweden, forming the curious &ldquo;lake ore.&rdquo; Larger
concretions formed under other conditions are known as &ldquo;bean ore.&rdquo;
Limonite often forms a cementing medium in ferruginous sands and
gravels, forming &ldquo;pan&rdquo;; and in like manner it is the agglutinating
agent in many conglomerates, like the South African &ldquo;banket,&rdquo;
where it is auriferous. In iron-shot sands the limonite may form
hollow concretions, known in some cases as &ldquo;boxes.&rdquo; The &ldquo;eagle
stones&rdquo; of older writers were generally concretions of this kind,
containing some substance, like sand, which rattled when the hollow
nodule was shaken. Bog iron ore is an impure limonite, usually
formed by the influence of micro-organisms, and containing silica,
phosphoric acid and organic matter, sometimes with manganese. The
various kinds of brown and yellow ochre are mixtures of limonite
with clay and other impurities; whilst in umber much manganese
oxide is present. Argillaceous brown iron ore is often known in
Germany as <i>Thoneisenstein</i>; but the corresponding term in English
(clay iron stone) is applied to nodular forms of impure chalybite.
J. C. Ullmann&rsquo;s name of stilpnosiderite, from the Greek <span class="grk" title="stilpnos">&#963;&#964;&#953;&#955;&#960;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>
(shining) is sometimes applied to such kinds of limonite as have a
pitchy lustre. Deposits of limonite in cavities may have a rounded
surface or even a stalactitic form, and may present a brilliant
lustre, of blackish colour, forming what is called in Germany <i>Glaskopf</i>
(glass head). It often happens that analyses of brown iron ores
reveal a larger proportion of water than required by the typical
formula of limonite, and hence new species have been recognized.
Thus the yellowish brown ore called by E. Schmidt xanthosiderite,
from <span class="grk" title="zanthos">&#950;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span> (yellow) and <span class="grk" title="sidêros">&#963;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> (iron), contains Fe<span class="su">2</span>O(OH)<span class="su">4</span>, or
Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·2H<span class="su">2</span>O; whilst the bog ore known as limnite, from <span class="grk" title="limnê">&#955;&#943;&#956;&#957;&#951;</span> (marsh)
has the formula Fe(OH)<span class="su">3</span>, or Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·3H<span class="su">2</span>O. On the other hand there
are certain forms of ferric hydrate containing less water than limonite
and approaching to haematite in their red colour and streak: such
is the mineral which was called hydrohaematite by A. Breithaupt,
and is now generally known under R. Hermann&rsquo;s name of turgite,
from the mines of Turginsk, near Bogoslovsk in the Ural Mountains.
This has the formula Fe<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">5</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, or 2Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O. It probably
represents the partial dehydration of limonite, and by further loss
of water may pass into haematite or red iron ore. When limonite
is dehydrated and deoxidized in the presence of carbonic acid, it
may give rise to chalybite.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMOUSIN<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Limosin</span>), <span class="bold">LÉONARD</span> (<i>c.</i> 1505-<i>c.</i> 1577), French
painter, the most famous of a family of seven Limoges enamel
painters, was the son of a Limoges innkeeper. He is supposed
to have studied under Nardon Pénicaud. He was certainly
at the beginning of his career influenced by the German school&mdash;indeed,
his earliest authenticated work, signed L. L. and dated
1532, is a series of eighteen plaques of the &ldquo;Passion of the Lord,&rdquo;
after Albrecht Dürer, but this influence was counter-balanced
by that of the Italian masters of the school of Fontainebleau,
Primaticcio, Rosso, Giulio Romano and Solario, from whom he
acquired his taste for arabesque ornament and for mythological
subjects. Nevertheless the French tradition was sufficiently
ingrained in him to save him from becoming an imitator and from
losing his personal style. In 1530 he entered the service of
Francis I. as painter and <i>varlet de chambre</i>, a position which he
retained under Henry II. For both these monarchs he executed
many portraits in enamel&mdash;among them quite a number of
plaques depicting Diane de Poitiers in various characters,&mdash;plates,
vases, ewers, and cups, besides decorative works for the
royal palaces, for, though he is best known as an enameller
distinguished for rich colour, and for graceful designs in grisaille
on black or bright blue backgrounds, he also enjoyed a great
reputation as an oil-painter. His last signed works bear the date
1574, but the date of his death is uncertain, though it could
not have been later than the beginning of 1577. It is on record
that he executed close upon two thousand enamels. He is best
represented at the Louvre, which owns his two famous votive
tablets for the Sainte Chapelle, each consisting of twenty-three
plaques, signed L. L. and dated 1553; &ldquo;La Chasse,&rdquo; depicting
Henry II. on a white horse, Diane de Poitiers behind him on
horseback; and many portraits, including the kings by whom
he was employed, Marguerite de Valois, the duc de Guise, and
the cardinal de Lorraine. Other representative examples are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page701" id="page701"></a>701</span>
at the Cluny and Limoges museums. In England some magnificent
examples of his work are to be found at the Victoria and
Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Wallace Collection.
In the collection of Signor Rocchi, in Rome, is an exceptionally
interesting plaque representing Frances I. consulting a fortune-teller.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMOUSIN<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Pagus Lemovicinus, ager Lemovicensis, regio
Lemovicum, Lemozinum, Limosinium</i>, &amp;c.), a former province of
France. In the time of Julius Caesar the <i>pagus Lemovicinus</i>
covered the county now comprised in the departments of Haute-Vienne,
Corrèze and Creuse, with the <i>arrondissements</i> of Confolens
in Charente and Nontron in Dordogne. These limits it retained
until the 10th century, and they survived in those of the diocese
of Limoges (except a small part cut off in 1317 to form that of
Tulle) until 1790. The break-up into great fiefs in the 10th
century, however, tended rapidly to disintegrate the province,
until at the close of the 12th century Limousin embraced only
the viscounties of Limoges, Turenne and Comborn, with a few
ecclesiastical lordships, corresponding roughly to the present
<i>arrondissements</i> of Limoges and Saint Yrien in Haute-Vienne and
part of the <i>arrondissements</i> of Brive, Tulle and Ussel in Corrèze.
In the 17th century Limousin, thus constituted, had become no
more than a small <i>gouvernement</i>.</p>

<p>Limousin takes its name from the <i>Lemovices</i>, a Gallic tribe
whose county was included by Augustus in the province of
<i><span class="correction" title="amended from Aquitanic">Aquitania</span> Magna</i>. Politically its history has little of separate
interest; it shared in general the vicissitudes of Aquitaine,
whose dukes from 918 onwards were its over-lords at least till
1264, after which it was sometimes under them, sometimes under
the counts of Poitiers, until the French kings succeeded in
asserting their direct over-lordship. It was, however, until the
14th century, the centre of a civilization of which the enamelling
industry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Enamel</a></span>) was only one expression. The Limousin
dialect, now a mere <i>patois</i>, was regarded by the troubadours as
the purest form of Provençal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIMPOPO,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Crocodile</span>, a river of S.E. Africa over 1000 m.
in length, next to the Zambezi the largest river of Africa entering
the Indian Ocean. Its head streams rise on the northern slopes
of the Witwatersrand less than 300 m. due W. of the sea, but
the river makes a great semicircular sweep across the high
plateau first N.W., then N.E. and finally S.E. It is joined early
in its course by the Marico and Notwani, streams which rise
along the westward continuation of the Witwatersrand, the
ridge forming the water-parting between the Vaal and the
Limpopo basins. For a great part of its course the Limpopo
forms the north-west and north frontiers of the Transvaal. Its
banks are well wooded and present many picturesque views.
In descending the escarpment of the plateau the river passes
through rocky ravines, piercing the Zoutpansberg near the north-east
corner of the Transvaal at the Toli Azimé Falls. In the
low country it receives its chief affluent, the Olifants river
(450 m. long), which, rising in the high veld of the Transvaal
east of the sources of the Limpopo, takes a more direct N.E.
course than the main stream. The Limpopo enters the ocean
in 25° 15&prime; S. The mouth, about 1000 ft. wide, is obstructed by
sandbanks. In the rainy season the Limpopo loses a good deal
of its water in the swampy region along its lower course. High-water
level is 24 ft. above low-water level, when the depth in
the shallowest part does not exceed 3 ft. The river is navigable
all the year round by shallow-draught vessels from its mouth for
about 100 m., to a spot known as Gungunyana&rsquo;s Ford. In flood
time there is water communication south with the river Komati
(<i>q.v.</i>). At this season stretches of the Limpopo above Gungunyana&rsquo;s
Ford are navigable. The river valley is generally
unhealthy.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The basin of the Limpopo includes the northern part of the
Transvaal, the eastern portion of Bechuanaland, southern Matabeleland
and a large area of Portuguese territory north of Delagoa Bay.
Its chief tributary, the Olifants, has been mentioned. Of its many
other affluents, the Macloutsie, the Shashi and the Tuli are the most
distant north-west feeders. In this direction the Matoppos and
other hills of Matabeleland separate the Limpopo basin from the
valley of the Zambezi. A little above the Tuli confluence is Rhodes&rsquo;s
Drift, the usual crossing-place from the northern Transvaal into
Matabeleland. Among the streams which, flowing north through
the Transvaal, join the Limpopo is the Nylstroom, so named by
Boers trekking from the south in the belief that they had reached
the river Nile. In the coast region the river has one considerable
affluent from the north, the Chengane, which is navigable for some
distance.</p>

<p>The Limpopo is a river of many names. In its upper course
called the Crocodile that name is also applied to the whole river,
which figures on old Portuguese maps as the Oori (or Oira) and Bembe.
Though claiming the territory through which it ran the Portuguese
made no attempt to trace the river. This was first done by Captain
J. F. Elton, who in 1870 travelling from the Tati goldfields sought
to open a road to the sea via the Limpopo. He voyaged down the
river from the Shashi confluence to the Toli Azimé Falls, which he
discovered, following the stream thence on foot to the low country.
The lower course of the river had been explored 1868-1869 by another
British traveller&mdash;St Vincent Whitshed Erskine. It was first
navigated by a sea-going craft in 1884, when G. A. Chaddock of the
British mercantile service succeeded in crossing the bar, while its
lower course was accurately surveyed by Portuguese officers in 1895-1896.
At the junction of the Lotsani, one of the Bechuanaland
affluents, with the Limpopo, are ruins of the period of the
Zimbabwes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINACRE<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Lynaker</span>), <span class="bold">THOMAS</span> (<i>c.</i> 1460-1524), English
humanist and physician, was probably born at Canterbury.
Of his parentage or descent nothing certain is known. He
received his early education at the cathedral school of Canterbury,
then under the direction of William Celling (William Tilly of
Selling), who became prior of Canterbury in 1472. Celling was
an ardent scholar, and one of the earliest in England who
cultivated Greek learning. From him Linacre must have received
his first incentive to this study. Linacre entered Oxford about
the year 1480, and in 1484 was elected a fellow of All Souls&rsquo;
College. Shortly afterwards he visited Italy in the train of
Celling, who was sent by Henry VIII. as an envoy to the papal
court, and he accompanied his patron as far as Bologna. There
he became the pupil of Angelo Poliziano, and afterwards shared
the instruction which that great scholar imparted at Florence
to the sons of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici. The younger of these princes
became Pope Leo X., and was in after years mindful of his old
companionship with Linacre. Among his other teachers and
friends in Italy were Demetrius Chalcondylas, Hermolaus
Barbaras, Aldus Romanus the printer of Venice, and Nicolaus
Leonicenus of Vicenza. Linacre took the degree of doctor of
medicine with great distinction at Padua. On his return to
Oxford, full of the learning and imbued with the spirit of the
Italian Renaissance, he formed one of the brilliant circle of
Oxford scholars, including John Colet, William Grocyn and
William Latimer, who are mentioned with so much warm
eulogy in the letters of Erasmus.</p>

<p>Linacre does not appear to have practised or taught medicine
in Oxford. About the year 1501 he was called to court as tutor
of the young prince Arthur. On the accession of Henry VIII.
he was appointed the king&rsquo;s physician, an office at that time of
considerable influence and importance, and practised medicine
in London, having among his patients most of the great statesmen
and prelates of the time, as Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop Warham
and Bishop Fox.</p>

<p>After some years of professional activity, and when in advanced
life, Linacre received priest&rsquo;s orders in 1520, though he had for
some years previously held several clerical benefices. There is
no doubt that his ordination was connected with his retirement
from active life. Literary labours, and the cares of the foundation
which owed its existence chiefly to him, the Royal College
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page702" id="page702"></a>702</span>
of Physicians, occupied Linacre&rsquo;s remaining years till his death
on the 20th of October 1524.</p>

<p>Linacre was more of a scholar than a man of letters, and
rather a man of learning than a scientific investigator. It is
difficult now to judge of his practical skill in his profession, but
it was evidently highly esteemed in his own day. He took no
part in political or theological questions, and died too soon to
have to declare himself on either side in the formidable controversies
which were even in his lifetime beginning to arise. But
his career as a scholar was one eminently characteristic of the
critical period in the history of learning through which he lived.
He was one of the first Englishmen who studied Greek in Italy,
whence he brought back to his native country and his own university
the lessons of the &ldquo;New Learning.&rdquo; His teachers were
some of the greatest scholars of the day. Among his pupils was
one&mdash;Erasmus&mdash;whose name alone would suffice to preserve
the memory of his instructor in Greek, and others of note in
letters and politics, such as Sir Thomas More, Prince Arthur and
Queen Mary. Colet, Grocyn, William Lilye and other eminent
scholars were his intimate friends, and he was esteemed by a still
wider circle of literary correspondents in all parts of Europe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Linacre&rsquo;s literary activity was displayed in two directions, in pure
scholarship and in translation from the Greek. In the domain of
scholarship he was known by the rudiments of (Latin) grammar
(<i>Progymnasmata Grammatices vulgaria</i>), composed in English, a
revised version of which was made for the use of the Princess Mary,
and afterwards translated into Latin by Robert Buchanan. He
also wrote a work on Latin composition, <i>De emendata structura
Latini sermonis</i>, which was published in London in 1524 and many
times reprinted on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Linacre&rsquo;s only medical works were his translations. He desired
to make the works of Galen (and indeed those of Aristotle also)
accessible to all readers of Latin. What he effected in the case of
the first, though not trifling in itself, is inconsiderable as compared
with the whole mass of Galen&rsquo;s writings; and of his translations
from Aristotle, some of which are known to have been completed,
nothing has survived. The following are the works of Galen translated
by Linacre: (1) <i>De sanitate tuenda</i>, printed at Paris in
1517; (2) <i>Methodus medendi</i> (Paris, 1519); (3) <i>De temperamentis
et de Inaequali Intemperie</i> (Cambridge, 1521); (4) <i>De naturalibus
facultatibus</i> (London, 1523); (5) <i>De symptomatum differentiis et
causis</i> (London, 1524); (6) <i>De pulsuum Usu</i> (London, without
date). He also translated for the use of Prince Arthur an astronomical
treatise of Proclus, <i>De sphaera</i>, which was printed at Venice by
Aldus in 1499. The accuracy of these translations and their elegance
of style were universally admitted. They have been generally
accepted as the standard versions of those parts of Galen&rsquo;s writings,
and frequently reprinted, either as a part of the collected works or
separately.</p>

<p>But the most important service which Linacre conferred upon his
own profession and science was not by his writings. To him was
chiefly owing the foundation by royal charter of the College of
Physicians in London, and he was the first president of the new
college, which he further aided by conveying to it his own house,
and by the gift of his library. Shortly before his death Linacre
obtained from the king letters patent for the establishment of
readerships in medicine at Oxford and Cambridge, and placed
valuable estates in the hands of trustees for their endowment.
Two readerships were founded in Merton College, Oxford, and one
in St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, but owing to neglect and bad
management of the funds, they fell into uselessness and obscurity.
The Oxford foundation was revived by the university commissioners
in 1856 in the form of the Linacre professorship of anatomy.
Posterity has done justice to the generosity and public spirit which
prompted these foundations; and it is impossible not to recognize
a strong constructive genius in the scheme of the College of Physicians,
by which Linacre not only first organized the medical profession in
England, but impressed upon it for some centuries the stamp of his
own individuality.</p>

<p>The intellectual fastidiousness of Linacre, and his habits of minute
accuracy were, as Erasmus suggests, the chief cause why he left
no more permanent literary memorials. It will be found, perhaps,
difficult to justify by any extant work the extremely high reputation
which he enjoyed among the scholars of his time. His Latin style
was so much admired that, according to the flattering eulogium of
Erasmus, Galen spoke better Latin in the version of Linacre than
he had before spoken Greek; and even Aristotle displayed a grace
which he hardly attained to in his native tongue. Erasmus praises
also Linacre&rsquo;s critical judgment (&ldquo;vir non exacti tantum sed severi
judicii&rdquo;). According to others it was hard to say whether he were
more distinguished as a grammarian or a rhetorician. Of Greek
he was regarded as a consummate master; and he was equally
eminent as a &ldquo;philosopher,&rdquo; that is, as learned in the works of the
ancient philosophers and naturalists. In this there may have been
some exaggeration; but all have acknowledged the elevation of
Linacre&rsquo;s character, and the fine moral qualities summed up in the
epitaph written by John Caius: &ldquo;Fraudes dolosque mire perosus;
fidus amicis; omnibus ordinibus juxta carus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The materials for Linacre&rsquo;s biography are to a large extent contained
in the older biographical collections of George Lilly (in
Paulus Jovius, <i>Descriptio Britanniae</i>), Bale, Leland and Pits, in
Wood&rsquo;s <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i> and in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>;
but all are completely collected in the <i>Life of Thomas Linacre</i>, by
Dr Noble Johnson (London, 1835). Reference may also be made
to Dr Munk&rsquo;s <i>Roll of the Royal College of Physicians</i> (2nd ed., London,
1878); and the Introduction, by Dr J. F. Payne, to a facsimile
reproduction of Linacre&rsquo;s version of <i>Galen de temperamentis</i> (Cambridge,
1881). With the exception of this treatise, none of Linacre&rsquo;s
works or translations has been reprinted in modern times.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINARES,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> an inland province of central Chile, between Talca
on the N. and &#323;uble on the S., bounded E. by Argentina and
W. by the province of Maule. Pop. (1895) 101,858; area,
3942 sq. m. The river Maule forms its northern boundary and
drains its northern and north-eastern regions. The province
belongs partly to the great central valley of Chile and partly
to the western slopes of the Andes, the S. Pedro volcano rising
to a height of 11,800 ft. not far from the sources of the Maule.
The northern part is fertile, as are the valleys of the Andean
foothills, but arid conditions prevail throughout the central
districts, and irrigation is necessary for the production of crops.
The vine is cultivated to some extent, and good pasturage is
found on the Andean slopes. The province is traversed from
N. to S. by the Chilean Central railway, and the river Maule
gives access to the small port of Constitucion, at its mouth.
From Parral, near the southern boundary, a branch railway
extends westward to Cauquenes, the capital of Maule. The
capital, Linares, is centrally situated, on an open plain, about
20 m. S. of the river Maule. It had a population of 7331 in 1895
(which an official estimate of 1902 reduced to 7256). Parral
(pop. 8586 in 1895; est. 10,219 in 1902) is a railway junction
and manufacturing town.</p>

among the southern foothills of the Sierra Morena, 1375 ft. above
sea-level and 3 m. N.W. of the river Guadalimar. Pop. (1900)
38,245. It is connected by four branch railways with the important
argentiferous lead mines on the north-west, and with
the main railways from Madrid to Seville, Granada and the
principal ports on the south coast. The town was greatly
improved in the second half of the 19th century, when the town
hall, bull-ring, theatre and many other handsome buildings were
erected; it contains little of antiquarian interest save a fine
fountain of Roman origin. Its population is chiefly engaged in
the lead-mines, and in such allied industries as the manufacture
of gunpowder, dynamite, match for blasting purposes, rope and
the like. The mining plant is entirely imported, principally from
England; and smelting, desilverizing and the manufacture of
lead sheets, pipes, &amp;c., are carried on by British firms, which also
purchase most of the ore raised. Linares lead is unsurpassed in
quality, but the output tends to decrease. There is a thriving
local trade in grain, wine and oil. About 2 m. S. is the village of
Cazlona, which shows some remains of the ancient <i>Castulo</i>.
The ancient mines some 5 m. N., which are now known as Los
Pozos de Anibal, may possibly date from the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
when this part of Spain was ruled by the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINCOLN, EARLS OF.<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> The first earl of Lincoln was probably
William de Roumare (<i>c.</i> 1095-<i>c.</i> 1155), who was created earl
about 1140, although it is possible that William de Albini, earl of
Arundel, had previously held the earldom. Roumare&rsquo;s grandson,
another William de Roumare (<i>c.</i> 1150-<i>c.</i> 1198), is sometimes
called earl of Lincoln, but he was never recognized as such, and
about 1148 King Stephen granted the earldom to one of his
supporters, Gilbert de Gand (d. 1156), who was related to the
former earl. After Gilbert&rsquo;s death the earldom was dormant
for about sixty years; then in 1216 it was given to another
Gilbert de Gand, and later it was claimed by the great earl of
Chester, Ranulf, or Randulph, de Blundevill (d. 1232). From
Ranulf the title to the earldom passed through his sister Hawise
to the family of Lacy, John de Lacy (d. 1240) being made earl of
Lincoln in 1232. He was son of Roger de Lacy (d. 1212), justiciar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page703" id="page703"></a>703</span>
of England and constable of Chester. It was held by the Lacys
until the death of Henry, the 3rd earl. Henry served Edward I.
in Wales, France and Scotland, both as a soldier and a diplomatist.
He went to France with Edmund, earl of Lancaster, in
1296, and when Edmund died in June of this year, succeeded him
as commander of the English forces in Gascony; but he did not
experience any great success in this capacity and returned to
England early in 1298. The earl fought at the battle of Falkirk
in July 1298, and took some part in the subsequent conquest
of Scotland. He was then employed by Edward to negotiate
successively with popes Boniface VIII. and Clement V., and also
with Philip IV. of France; and was present at the death of the
English king in July 1307. For a short time Lincoln was friendly
with the new king, Edward II., and his favourite, Piers Gaveston;
but quickly changing his attitude, he joined earl Thomas of
Lancaster and the baronial party, was one of the &ldquo;ordainers&rdquo;
appointed in 1310 and was regent of the kingdom during the
king&rsquo;s absence in Scotland in the same year. He died in London
on the 5th of February 1311, and was buried in St Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral. He married Margaret (d. 1309), granddaughter and
heiress of William Longsword, 2nd earl of Salisbury, and his only
surviving child, Alice (1283-1348), became the wife of Thomas,
earl of Lancaster, who thus inherited his father-in-law&rsquo;s earldoms
of Lincoln and Salisbury. Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in London gets its name
from the earl, whose London residence occupied this site. He
founded Whalley Abbey in Lancashire, and built Denbigh Castle.</p>

<p>In 1349 Henry Plantagenet, earl (afterwards duke) of Lancaster,
a nephew of Earl Thomas, was created earl of Lincoln; and when
his grandson Henry became king of England as Henry IV. in
1399 the title merged in the crown. In 1467 John de la Pole
(<i>c.</i> 1464-1487), a nephew of Edward IV., was made earl of
Lincoln, and the same dignity was conferred in 1525 upon Henry
Brandon (1516-1545), son of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk.
Both died without sons, and the next family to hold the earldom
was that of Clinton.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Edward Fiennes Clinton</span>, 9th Lord Clinton (1512-1585),
lord high admiral and the husband of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s mistress,
Elizabeth Blount, was created earl of Lincoln in 1572. Before
his elevation he had rendered very valuable services both on sea
and land to Edward VI., to Mary and to Elizabeth, and he was
in the confidence of the leading men of these reigns, including
William Cecil, Lord Burghley. From 1572 until the present day
the title has been held by Clinton&rsquo;s descendants. In 1768 Henry
Clinton, the 9th earl (1720-1794), succeeded his uncle Thomas
Pelham as 2nd duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, and since this date
the title of earl of Lincoln has been the courtesy title of the eldest
son of the duke of Newcastle.</p>

Abraham Lincoln, settled in Kentucky about 1780 and was killed
by Indians in 1784. His father, Thomas (1778-1851), was born
in Rockingham (then Augusta) county, Virginia; he was hospitable,
shiftless, restless and unsuccessful, working now as a
carpenter and now as a farmer, and could not read or write
before his marriage, in Washington county, Kentucky, on the
12th of June 1806, to Nancy Hanks (1783-1818), who was,
like him, a native of Virginia, but had much more strength of
character and native ability, and seemed to have been, in
intellect and character, distinctly above the social class in which
she was born. The Lincolns had removed from Elizabethtown,
Hardin county, their first home, to the Rock Spring farm, only
a short time before Abraham&rsquo;s birth; about 1813 they removed
to a farm of 238 acres on Knob Creek, about 6 m. from Hodgenville;
and in 1816 they crossed the Ohio river and settled on a
quarter-section, 1½ m. E. of the present village of Gentryville, in
Spencer county, Indiana. There Abraham&rsquo;s mother died on the
5th of October 1818. In December 1819 his father married, at
his old home, Elizabethtown, Mrs Sarah (Bush) Johnston (d.
1869), whom he had courted years before, whose thrift greatly
improved conditions in the home, and who exerted a great influence
over her stepson. Spencer county was still a wilderness,
and the boy grew up in pioneer surroundings, living in a rude
log-cabin, enduring many hardships and knowing only the
primitive manners, conversation and ambitions of sparsely
settled backwoods communities. Schools were rare, and teachers
qualified only to impart the merest rudiments. &ldquo;Of course
when I came of age I did not know much,&rdquo; wrote he years
afterward, &ldquo;still somehow I could read, write and cipher to
the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to school
since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education
I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of
necessity.&rdquo; His entire schooling, in five different schools,
amounted to less than a twelvemonth; but he became a good
speller and an excellent penman. His own mother taught him
to read, and his stepmother urged him to study. He read and
re-read in early boyhood the Bible, Aesop, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, Weems&rsquo;s <i>Life of Washington</i> and a history of
the United States; and later read every book he could borrow
from the neighbours, Burns and Shakespeare becoming
favourites. He wrote rude, coarse satires, crude verse, and
compositions on the American government, temperance, &amp;c.
At the age of seventeen he had attained his full height, and began
to be known as a wrestler, runner and lifter of great weights.
When nineteen he made a journey as a hired hand on a flatboat
to New Orleans.</p>

<p>In March 1830 his father emigrated to Macon county, Illinois
(near the present Decatur), and soon afterward removed to
Coles county. Being now twenty-one years of age, Abraham
hired himself to Denton Offutt, a migratory trader and storekeeper
then of Sangamon county, and he helped Offutt to build
a flatboat and float it down the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi
rivers to New Orleans. In 1831 Offutt made him clerk of his
country store at New Salem, a small and unsuccessful settlement
in Menard county; this gave him moments of leisure to devote
to self-education. He borrowed a grammar and other books,
sought explanations from the village schoolmaster and began
to read law. In this frontier community law and politics claimed
a large proportion of the stronger and the more ambitious men;
the law early appealed to Lincoln and his general popularity
encouraged him as early as 1832 to enter politics. In this year
Offutt failed and Lincoln was thus left without employment.
He became a candidate for the Illinois House of Representatives;
and on the 9th of March 1832 issued an address &ldquo;To the people
of Sangamon county&rdquo; which betokens talent and education
far beyond mere ability to &ldquo;read, write and cipher,&rdquo; though in
its preparation he seems to have had the help of a friend. Before
the election the Black Hawk Indian War broke out; Lincoln
volunteered in one of the Sangamon county companies on the
21st of April and was elected captain by the members of the
company. It is said that the oath of allegiance was administered
to Lincoln at this time by Lieut. Jefferson Davis. The
company, a part of the 4th Illinois, was mustered out after
the five weeks&rsquo; service for which it volunteered, and Lincoln re-enlisted
as a private on the 29th of May, and was finally mustered
out on the 16th of June by Lieut. Robert Anderson, who in 1861
commanded the Union troops at Fort Sumter. As captain
Lincoln was twice in disgrace, once for firing a pistol near camp
and again because nearly his entire company was intoxicated.
He was in no battle, and always spoke lightly of his military
record. He was defeated in his campaign for the legislature in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page704" id="page704"></a>704</span>
1832, partly because of his unpopular adherence to Clay and the
American system, but in his own election precinct, he received
nearly all the votes cast. With a friend, William Berry, he then
bought a small country store, which soon failed chiefly because
of the drunken habits of Berry and because Lincoln preferred
to read and to tell stories&mdash;he early gained local celebrity as
a story-teller&mdash;rather than sell; about this time he got hold of
a set of Blackstone. In the spring of 1833 the store&rsquo;s stock was
sold to satisfy its creditors, and Lincoln assumed the firm&rsquo;s
debts, which he did not fully pay off for fifteen years. In May
1833, local friendship, disregarding politics, procured his appointment
as postmaster of New Salem, but this paid him very little,
and in the same year the county surveyor of Sangamon county
opportunely offered to make him one of his deputies. He hastily
qualified himself by study, and entered upon the practical
duties of surveying farm lines, roads and town sites. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
to use his own words, &ldquo;procured bread, and kept body and
soul together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1834 Lincoln was elected (second of four successful candidates,
with only 14 fewer votes than the first) a member of the
Illinois House of Representatives, to which he was re-elected
in 1836, 1838 and 1840, serving until 1842. In his announcement
of his candidacy in 1836 he promised to vote for Hugh L. White
of Tennessee (a vigorous opponent of Andrew Jackson in
Tennessee politics) for president, and said: &ldquo;I go for all sharing
the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens.
Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage,
who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding females)&rdquo;&mdash;a
sentiment frequently quoted to prove Lincoln a believer in
woman&rsquo;s suffrage. In this election he led the poll in Sangamon
county. In the legislature, like the other representatives of
that county, who were called the &ldquo;Long Nine,&rdquo; because of their
stature, he worked for internal improvements, for which lavish
appropriations were made, and for the division of Sangamon
county and the choice of Springfield as the state capital, instead
of Vandalia. He and his party colleagues followed Stephen A.
Douglas in adopting the convention system, to which Lincoln
had been strongly opposed. In 1837 with one other representative
from Sangamon county, named Dan Stone, he protested
against a series of resolutions, adopted by the Illinois General
Assembly, expressing disapproval of the formation of abolition
societies and asserting, among other things, that &ldquo;the right of
property in slaves is sacred to the slave holding states under the
Federal Constitution&rdquo;; and Lincoln and Stone put out a paper
in which they expressed their belief &ldquo;that the institution of
slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but that
the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase
than abate its evils,&rdquo; &ldquo;that the Congress of the United States
has no power under the Constitution to interfere with the institution
of slavery in the different states,&rdquo; &ldquo;that the Congress of
the United States has the power, under the Constitution, to
abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but that the power
ought not to be exercised unless at the request of the people
of the District.&rdquo; Lincoln was very popular among his fellow
legislators, and in 1838 and in 1840 he received the complimentary
vote of his minority colleagues for the speakership of the state
House of Representatives. In 1842 he declined a renomination
to the state legislature and attempted unsuccessfully to secure
a nomination to Congress. In the same year he became interested
in the Washingtonian temperance movement.</p>

<p>In 1846 he was elected a member of the National House of
Representatives by a majority of 1511 over his Democratic
opponent, Peter Cartwright, the Methodist preacher. Lincoln
was the only Whig member of Congress elected in Illinois
in 1846. In the House of Representatives on the 22nd of
December 1847 he introduced the &ldquo;Spot Resolutions,&rdquo; which
quoted statements in the president&rsquo;s messages of the 11th of
May 1846 and the 7th and 8th of December that Mexican troops
had invaded the territory of the United States, and asked the
president to tell the precise &ldquo;spot&rdquo; of invasion; he made a
speech on these resolutions in the House on the 12th of January
1848. His attitude toward the war and especially his vote for
George Ashmun&rsquo;s amendment to the supply bill at this session,
declaring that the Mexican War was &ldquo;unnecessarily and unconstitutionally
commenced by the President,&rdquo; greatly displeased
his constituents. He later introduced a bill regarding slavery in
the District of Columbia, which (in accordance with his statement
of 1837) was to be submitted to the vote of the District
for approval, and which provided for compensated emancipation,
forbade the bringing of slaves into the District of Columbia,
except by government officials from slave states, and the selling
of slaves away from the District, and arranged for the emancipation
after a period of apprenticeship of all slave children born
after the 1st of January 1850. While he was in Congress he
voted repeatedly for the principle of the Wilmot Proviso. At
the close of his term in 1848 he declined an appointment as
governor of the newly organized Territory of Oregon and for a
time worked, without success, for an appointment as Commissioner
of the General Land Office. During the presidential
campaign he made speeches in Illinois, and in Massachusetts
he spoke before the Whig State Convention at Worcester on
the 12th of September, and in the next ten days at Lowell,
Dedham, Roxbury, Chelsea, Cambridge and Boston. He had
become an eloquent and influential public speaker, and in 1840
and 1844 was a candidate on the Whig ticket for presidential
elector.</p>

<p>In 1834 his political friend and colleague John Todd Stuart
(1807-1885), a lawyer in full practice, had urged him to fit
himself for the bar, and had lent him text-books; and Lincoln,
working diligently, was admitted to the bar in September 1836.
In April 1837 he quitted New Salem, and removed to Springfield,
which was the county-seat and was soon to become the capital
of the state, to begin practice in a partnership with Stuart,
which was terminated in April 1841; from that time until
September 1843 he was junior partner to Stephen Trigg Logan
(1800-1880), and from 1843 until his death he was senior partner
of William Henry Herndon (1818-1891). Between 1849 and
1854 he took little part in politics, devoted himself to the law
and became one of the leaders of the Illinois bar. His small
fees&mdash;he once charged $3.50 for collecting an account of nearly
$600.00&mdash;his frequent refusals to take cases which he did not
think right and his attempts to prevent unnecessary litigation
have become proverbial. Judge David Davis, who knew
Lincoln on the Illinois circuit and whom Lincoln made in October
1862 an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, said that he was &ldquo;great both at <i>nisi prius</i> and before
an appellate tribunal.&rdquo; He was an excellent cross-examiner,
whose candid friendliness of manner often succeeded in eliciting
important testimony from unwilling witnesses. Among Lincoln&rsquo;s
most famous cases were: one (<i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Cromwell</i>, 4 Ill. 71;
frequently cited) before the Illinois Supreme Court in July 1841
in which he argued against the validity of a note in payment
for a negro girl, adducing the Ordinance of 1787 and other
authorities; a case (tried in Chicago in September 1857) for
the Rock Island railway, sued for damages by the owners of a
steamboat sunk after collision with a railway bridge, a trial in
which Lincoln brought to the service of his client a surveyor&rsquo;s
knowledge of mathematics and a riverman&rsquo;s acquaintance with
currents and channels, and argued that crossing a stream by
bridge was as truly a common right as navigating it by boat,
thus contributing to the success of Chicago and railway commerce
in the contest against St Louis and river transportation; the
defence (at Beardstown in May 1858) on the charge of murder of
William (&ldquo;Duff&rdquo;) Armstrong, son of one of Lincoln&rsquo;s New
Salem friends, whom Lincoln freed by controverting with the
help of an almanac the testimony of a crucial witness that between
10 and 11 o&rsquo;clock at night he had seen by moonlight the defendant
strike the murderous blow&mdash;this dramatic incident is described
in Edward Eggleston&rsquo;s novel, <i>The Graysons</i>; and the defence
on the charge of murder (committed in August 1859) of
&ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; Harrison, a grandson of Peter Cartwright, whose
testimony was used with great effect.</p>

<p>From law, however, Lincoln was soon drawn irresistibly
back into politics. The slavery question, in one form or another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page705" id="page705"></a>705</span>
had become the great overshadowing issue in national, and even
in state politics; the abolition movement, begun in earnest
by W. L. Garrison in 1831, had stirred the conscience of the
North, and had had its influence even upon many who strongly
deprecated its extreme radicalism; the Compromise of 1850
had failed to silence sectional controversy, and the Fugitive
Slave Law, which was one of the compromise measures, had
throughout the North been bitterly assailed and to a considerable
extent had been nullified by state legislation; and finally in 1854
the slavery agitation was fomented by the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska
Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise and
gave legislative sanction to the principle of &ldquo;popular sovereignty&rdquo;&mdash;the
principle that the inhabitants of each Territory as well as of
each state were to be left free to decide for themselves whether
or not slavery was to be permitted therein. In enacting this
measure Congress had been dominated largely by one man&mdash;Stephen
A. Douglas of Illinois&mdash;then probably the most powerful
figure in national politics. Lincoln had early put himself on
record as opposed to slavery, but he was never technically an
abolitionist; he allied himself rather with those who believed
that slavery should be fought within the Constitution, that,
though it could not be constitutionally interfered with in individual
states, it should be excluded from territory over which
the national government had jurisdiction. In this, as in other
things, he was eminently clear-sighted and practical. Already
he had shown his capacity as a forcible and able debater;
aroused to new activity upon the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill, which he regarded as a gross breach of political faith, he
now entered upon public discussion with an earnestness and force
that by common consent gave him leadership in Illinois of the
opposition, which in 1854 elected a majority of the legislature;
and it gradually became clear that he was the only man who
could be opposed in debate to the powerful and adroit Douglas.
He was elected to the state House of Representatives, from
which he immediately resigned to become a candidate for
United States senator from Illinois, to succeed James Shields,
a Democrat; but five opposition members, of Democratic
antecedents, refused to vote for Lincoln (on the second ballot
he received 47 votes&mdash;50 being necessary to elect) and he turned
the votes which he controlled over to Lyman Trumbull, who was
opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and thus secured the
defeat of Joel Aldrich Matteson (1808-1883), who favoured this
act and who on the eighth ballot had received 47 votes to 35
for Trumbull and 15 for Lincoln. The various anti-Nebraska
elements came together, in Illinois as elsewhere, to form a new
party at a time when the old parties were disintegrating; and
in 1856 the Republican party was formally organized in the state.
Lincoln before the state convention at Bloomington of &ldquo;all
opponents of anti-Nebraska legislation&rdquo; (the first Republican
state convention in Illinois) made on the 29th of May a notable
address known as the &ldquo;Lost Speech.&rdquo; The National Convention
of the Republican Party in 1856 cast 110 votes for Lincoln as
its vice-presidential candidate on the ticket with Fremont, and
he was on the Republican electoral ticket of this year, and made
effective campaign speeches in the interest of the new party.
The campaign in the state resulted substantially in a drawn
battle, the Democrats gaining a majority in the state for president,
while the Republicans elected the governor and state officers.
In 1858 the term of Douglas in the United States Senate was
expiring, and he sought re-election. On the 16th of June 1858
by unanimous resolution of the Republican state convention
Lincoln was declared &ldquo;the first and only choice of the Republicans
of Illinois for the United States Senate as the successor
of Stephen A. Douglas,&rdquo; who was the choice of his own party
to succeed himself. Lincoln, addressing the convention which
nominated him, gave expression to the following bold prophecy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this
Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.
I do not expect the Union to be dissolved&mdash;I do not expect the
house to fall&mdash;but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will
become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of
slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the
public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate
extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become
alike lawful in all the states, old as well as new&mdash;North as well as
South.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In this speech, delivered in the state House of Representatives,
Lincoln charged Pierce, Buchanan, Taney and Douglas with
conspiracy to secure the Dred Scott decision. Yielding to the
wish of his party friends, on the 24th of July, Lincoln challenged
Douglas to a joint public discussion.<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The antagonists met in
debate at seven designated places in the state. The first meeting
was at Ottawa, La Salle County, about 90 m. south-west of
Chicago, on the 21st of August. At Freeport, on the Wisconsin
boundary, on the 27th of August, Lincoln answered questions put
to him by Douglas, and by his questions forced Douglas to &ldquo;betray
the South&rdquo; by his enunciation of the &ldquo;Freeport heresy,&rdquo; that, no
matter what the character of Congressional legislation or the
Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;slavery cannot exist a day or an
hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police regulations.&rdquo;
This adroit attempt to reconcile the principle of popular sovereignty
with the Dred Scott decision, though it undoubtedly
helped Douglas in the immediate fight for the senatorship,
necessarily alienated his Southern supporters and assured his
defeat, as Lincoln foresaw it must, in the presidential campaign
of 1860. The other debates were: at Jonesboro, in the southern
part of the state, on the 15th of September; at Charleston,
150 m. N.E. of Jonesboro, on the 18th of September; and, in
the western part of the state, at Galesburg (Oct. 7), Quincy
(Oct. 13) and Alton (Oct. 15). In these debates Douglas, the
champion of his party, was over-matched in clearness and force
of reasoning, and lacked the great moral earnestness of his
opponent; but he dexterously extricated himself time and again
from difficult argumentative positions, and retained sufficient
support to win the immediate prize. At the November election
the Republican vote was 126,084, the Douglas Democratic vote
was 121,940 and the Lecompton (or Buchanan) Democratic
vote was 5091; but the Democrats, through a favourable
apportionment of representative districts, secured a majority
of the legislature (Senate: 14 Democrats, 11 Republicans;
House: 40 Democrats, 35 Republicans), which re-elected
Douglas. Lincoln&rsquo;s speeches in this campaign won him a national
fame. In 1859 he made two speeches in Ohio&mdash;one at Columbus
on the 16th of September criticising Douglas&rsquo;s paper in the
September <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and one at Cincinnati on the
17th of September, which was addressed to Kentuckians,&mdash;and
he spent a few days in Kansas, speaking in Elwood, Troy,
Doniphan, Atchison and Leavenworth, in the first week of
December. On the 27th of February 1860 in Cooper Union,
New York City, he made a speech (much the same as that
delivered in Elwood, Kansas, on the 1st of December) which
made him known favourably to the leaders of the Republican
party in the East and which was a careful historical study
criticising the statement of Douglas in one of his speeches in
Ohio that &ldquo;our fathers when they framed the government under
which we live understood this question [slavery] just as well
and even better than we do now,&rdquo; and Douglas&rsquo;s contention that
&ldquo;the fathers&rdquo; made the country (and intended that it should
remain) part slave. Lincoln pointed out that the majority of
the members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 opposed
slavery and that they did not think that Congress had no power
to control slavery in the Territories. He spoke at Concord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page706" id="page706"></a>706</span>
Manchester, Exeter and Dover in New Hampshire, at Hartford
(5th March), New Haven (6th March), Woonsocket (8th March)
and Norwich (9th March). The Illinois State Convention of the
Republican party, held at Decatur on the 9th and 10th of May
1860, amid great enthusiasm declared Abraham Lincoln its
first choice for the presidential nomination, and instructed the
delegation to the National Convention to cast the vote of the
state as a unit for him.</p>

<p>The Republican national convention, which made &ldquo;No
Extension of Slavery&rdquo; the essential part of the party platform,
met at Chicago on the 16th of May 1860. At this time William
H. Seward was the most conspicuous Republican in national
politics, and Salmon P. Chase had long been in the fore-front of
the political contest against slavery. Both had won greater
national fame than had Lincoln, and, before the convention
met, each hoped to be nominated for president. Chase, however,
had little chance, and the contest was virtually between Seward
and Lincoln, who by many was considered more &ldquo;available,&rdquo;
because it was thought that he could (and Seward could not)
secure the vote of certain doubtful states. Lincoln&rsquo;s name was
presented by Illinois and seconded by Indiana. At first Seward
had the strongest support. On the first ballot Lincoln received
only 102 votes to 173½ for Seward. On the second ballot Lincoln
received 181 votes to Seward&rsquo;s 184½. On the third ballot the
50½ votes formerly given to Simon Cameron<a name="fa4g" id="fa4g" href="#ft4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> were given to
Lincoln, who received 231½ votes to 180 for Seward, and without
taking another ballot enough votes were changed to make
Lincoln&rsquo;s total 354 (233 being necessary for a choice) and the
nomination was then made unanimous. Hannibal Hamlin,
of Maine, was nominated for the vice-presidency. The convention
was singularly tumultuous and noisy; large claques were
hired by both Lincoln&rsquo;s and Seward&rsquo;s managers. During the
campaign Lincoln remained in Springfield, making few speeches
and writing practically no letters for publication. The campaign
was unusually animated&mdash;only the Whig campaign for William
Henry Harrison in 1840 is comparable to it: there were great
torchlight processions of &ldquo;wide-awake&rdquo; clubs, which did &ldquo;rail-fence,&rdquo;
or zigzag, marches, and carried rails in honour of their
candidate, the &ldquo;rail-splitter.&rdquo; Lincoln was elected by a popular
vote of 1,866,452 to 1,375,157 for Douglas, 847,953 for Breckinridge
and 590,631 for Bell&mdash;as the combined vote of his opponents
was so much greater than his own he was often called &ldquo;the
minority president&rdquo;; the electoral vote was: Lincoln, 180;
John C. Breckinridge, 72; John Bell, 39; Stephen A. Douglas,
12. On the 4th of March 1861 Lincoln was inaugurated as
president. (For an account of his administration see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United
States</a></span>: <i>History</i>.)</p>

<p>During the campaign radical leaders in the South frequently
asserted that the success of the Republicans at the polls would
mean that the rights of the slave-holding states under the
Federal constitution, as interpreted by them, would no longer
be respected by the North, and that, if Lincoln were elected,
it would be the duty of these slave-holding states to secede from
the Union. There was much opposition in these states to such
a course, but the secessionists triumphed, and by the time
President Lincoln was inaugurated, South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas had formally
withdrawn from the Union. A provisional government under
the designation &ldquo;The Confederate States of America,&rdquo; with
Jefferson Davis as president, was organized by the seceding
states, which seized by force nearly all the forts, arsenals and
public buildings within their limits. Great division of sentiment
existed in the North, whether in this emergency acquiescence
or coercion was the preferable policy. Lincoln&rsquo;s inaugural
address declared the Union perpetual and acts of secession void,
and announced the determination of the government to defend
its authority, and to hold forts and places yet in its possession.
He disclaimed any intention to invade, subjugate or oppress
the seceding states. &ldquo;You can have no conflict,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;without being yourselves the aggressors.&rdquo; Fort Sumter, in
Charleston harbour, had been besieged by the secessionists since
January; and, it being now on the point of surrender through
starvation, Lincoln sent the besiegers official notice on the
8th of April that a fleet was on its way to carry provisions to
the fort, but that he would not attempt to reinforce it unless
this effort were resisted. The Confederates, however, immediately
ordered its reduction, and after a thirty-four hours&rsquo; bombardment
the garrison capitulated on the 13th of April 1861.
(For the military history of the war, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American Civil War</a></span>.)</p>

<p>With civil war thus provoked, Lincoln, on the 15th of April,
by proclamation called 75,000 three months&rsquo; militia under
arms, and on the 4th of May ordered the further enlistment
of 64,748 soldiers and 18,000 seamen for three years&rsquo; service.
He instituted by proclamation of the 19th of April a blockade
of the Southern ports, took effective steps to extemporize a
navy, convened Congress in special session (on the 4th of July),
and asked for legislation and authority to make the war &ldquo;short,
sharp and decisive.&rdquo; The country responded with enthusiasm
to his summons and suggestions; and the South on its side
was not less active.</p>

<p>The slavery question presented vexatious difficulties in
conducting the war. Congress in August 1861 passed an act
(approved August 6th) confiscating rights of slave-owners to
slaves employed in hostile service against the Union. On
the 30th of August General Fremont by military order declared
martial law and confiscation against active enemies, with
freedom to their slaves, in the State of Missouri. Believing that
under existing conditions such a step was both detrimental in
present policy and unauthorized in law, President Lincoln
directed him (2nd September) to modify the order to make it
conform to the Confiscation Act of Congress, and on the 11th of
September annulled the parts of the order which conflicted with
this act. Strong political factions were instantly formed for
and against military emancipation, and the government was
hotly beset by antagonistic counsel. The Unionists of the
border slave states were greatly alarmed, but Lincoln by his
moderate conservatism held them to the military support of
the government.<a name="fa5g" id="fa5g" href="#ft5g"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Meanwhile he sagaciously prepared the
way for the supreme act of statesmanship which the gathering
national crisis already dimly foreshadowed. On the 6th of March
1862, he sent a special message to Congress recommending the
passage of a resolution offering pecuniary aid from the general
government to induce states to adopt gradual abolishment of
slavery. Promptly passed by Congress, the resolution produced
no immediate result except in its influence on public opinion.
A practical step, however, soon followed. In April Congress
passed and the president approved (6th April) an act emancipating
the slaves in the District of Columbia, with compensation to
owners&mdash;a measure which Lincoln had proposed when in Congress.
Meanwhile slaves of loyal masters were constantly escaping to
military camps. Some commanders excluded them altogether;
others surrendered them on demand; while still others sheltered
and protected them against their owners. Lincoln tolerated
this latitude as falling properly within the military discretion
pertaining to local army operations. A new case, however,
soon demanded his official interference. On the 9th of May 1862
General David Hunter, commanding in the limited areas gained
along the southern coast, issued a short order declaring his department
under martial law, and adding&mdash;&ldquo;Slavery and martial law in
a free country are altogether incompatible. The persons in these
three States&mdash;Georgia, Florida and South Carolina&mdash;heretofore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page707" id="page707"></a>707</span>
held as slaves are, therefore, declared for ever free.&rdquo; As soon
as this order, by the slow method of communication by sea,
reached the newspapers, Lincoln (May 19) published a proclamation
declaring it void; adding further, &ldquo;Whether it be competent
for me as commander-in-chief of the army and navy to
declare the slaves of any state or states free, and whether at any
time or in any case it shall have become a necessity indispensable
to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed
power, are questions which under my responsibility I reserve
to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the
decision of commanders in the field. These are totally different
questions from those of police regulations in armies or camps.&rdquo;
But in the same proclamation Lincoln recalled to the public
his own proposal and the assent of Congress to compensate states
which would adopt voluntary and gradual abolishment. &ldquo;To
the people of these states now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I must earnestly
appeal. I do not argue. I beseech you to make the argument
for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs
of the times.&rdquo; Meanwhile the anti-slavery sentiment of the
North constantly increased. Congress by express act (approved
on the 19th of June) prohibited the existence of slavery in all
territories outside of states. On July the 12th the president
called the representatives of the border slave states to the
executive mansion, and once more urged upon them his proposal
of compensated emancipation. &ldquo;If the war continues long,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;as it must if the object be not sooner attained, the
institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction
and abrasion&mdash;by the mere incidents of the war. It will be
gone, and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it.&rdquo; Although
Lincoln&rsquo;s appeal brought the border states to no practical
decision&mdash;the representatives of these states almost without
exception opposed the plan&mdash;it served to prepare public opinion
for his final act. During the month of July his own mind
reached the virtual determination to give slavery its <i>coup de
grâce</i>; on the 17th he approved a new Confiscation Act, much
broader than that of the 6th of August 1861 (which freed only
those slaves in military service against the Union) and giving to
the president power to employ persons of African descent for
the suppression of the rebellion; and on the 22nd he submitted
to his cabinet the draft of an emancipation proclamation substantially
as afterward issued. Serious military reverses constrained
him for the present to withhold it, while on the other hand
they served to increase the pressure upon him from anti-slavery
men. Horace Greeley having addressed a public letter to him
complaining of &ldquo;the policy you seem to be pursuing with regard
to the slaves of the rebels,&rdquo; the president replied on the 22nd of
August, saying, &ldquo;My paramount object is to save the Union,
and not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the
Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; if I could save
it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and, if I could do it by
freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.&rdquo;
Thus still holding back violent reformers with one hand, and
leading up halting conservatives with the other, he on the 13th
of September replied among other things to an address from
a delegation: &ldquo;I do not want to issue a document that the whole
world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the pope&rsquo;s
bull against the comet.... I view this matter as a practical war
measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages
it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.... I
have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the
slaves, but hold the matter under advisement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The year 1862 had opened with important Union victories.
Admiral A. H. Foote captured Fort Henry on the 6th of February,
and Gen. U. S. Grant captured Fort Donelson on the 16th of
February, and won the battle of Shiloh on the 6th and 7th
of April. Gen. A. E. Burnside took possession of Roanoke
island on the North Carolina coast (7th February). The famous
contest between the new ironclads &ldquo;Monitor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Merrimac&rdquo;
(9th April), though indecisive, effectually stopped the career
of the Confederate vessel, which was later destroyed by the
Confederates themselves. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hampton Roads</a></span>.) Farragut,
with a wooden fleet, ran past the twin forts St Philip and Jackson,
compelled the surrender of New Orleans (26th April), and
gained control of the lower Mississippi. The succeeding three
months brought disaster and discouragement to the Union
army. M&rsquo;Clellan&rsquo;s campaign against Richmond was made
abortive by his timorous generalship, and compelled the withdrawal
of his army. Pope&rsquo;s army, advancing against the same
city by another line, was beaten back upon Washington in defeat.
The tide of war, however, once more turned in the defeat of
Lee&rsquo;s invading army at South Mountain and Antietam in
Maryland on the 14th and on the 16th and 17th of September,
compelling him to retreat.</p>

<p>With public opinion thus ripened by alternate defeat and
victory, President Lincoln, on the 22nd of September 1862,
issued his preliminary proclamation of emancipation, giving
notice that on the 1st of January 1863, &ldquo;all persons held as
slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people
whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States
shall be then, thenceforward and for ever free.&rdquo; In his message
to Congress on the 1st of December following, he again urged
his plan of gradual, compensated emancipation (to be completed
on the 1st of December 1900) &ldquo;as a means, not in exclusion
of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving
the national authority throughout the Union.&rdquo; On the 1st
day of January 1863 the final proclamation of emancipation
was duly issued, designating the States of Arkansas, Texas,
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North
Carolina, and certain portions of Louisiana and Virginia, as
&ldquo;this day in rebellion against the United States,&rdquo; and proclaiming
that, in virtue of his authority as commander-in-chief,
and as a necessary war measure for suppressing rebellion,
&ldquo;I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said
designated states and parts of states are and henceforward shall
be free,&rdquo; and pledging the executive and military power of the
government to maintain such freedom. The legal validity of
these proclamations was never pronounced upon by the national
courts; but their decrees gradually enforced by the march of
armies were soon recognized by public opinion to be practically
irreversible.<a name="fa6g" id="fa6g" href="#ft6g"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Such dissatisfaction as they caused in the border
slave states died out in the stress of war. The systematic
enlistment of negroes and their incorporation into the army
by regiments, hitherto only tried as exceptional experiments,
were now pushed with vigour, and, being followed by several
conspicuous instances of their gallantry on the battlefield,
added another strong impulse to the sweeping change of popular
sentiment. To put the finality of emancipation beyond all
question, Lincoln in the winter session of 1863-1864 strongly
supported a movement in Congress to abolish slavery by constitutional
amendment, but the necessary two-thirds vote of the
House of Representatives could not then be obtained. In his
annual message of the 6th of December 1864, he urged the immediate
passage of the measure. Congress now acted promptly:
on the 31st of January 1865, that body by joint resolution
proposed to the states the 13th amendment of the Federal Constitution,
providing that &ldquo;neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United
States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.&rdquo; Before the
end of that year twenty-seven out of the thirty-six states of
the Union (being the required three-fourths) had ratified the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page708" id="page708"></a>708</span>
amendment, and official proclamation made by President Johnson
on the 18th of December 1865, declared it duly adopted.</p>

<p>The foreign policy of President Lincoln, while subordinate
in importance to the great questions of the Civil War, nevertheless
presented several difficult and critical problems for his decision.
The arrest (8th of November 1861) by Captain Charles Wilkes
of two Confederate envoys proceeding to Europe in the British
steamer &ldquo;Trent&rdquo; seriously threatened peace with England.
Public opinion in America almost unanimously sustained the
act; but Lincoln, convinced that the rights of Great Britain
as a neutral had been violated, promptly, upon the demand
of England, ordered the liberation of the prisoners (26th of
December). Later friendly relations between the United
States and Great Britain, where, among the upper classes,
there was a strong sentiment in favour of the Confederacy,
were seriously threatened by the fitting out of Confederate
privateers in British ports, and the Administration owed much
to the skilful diplomacy of the American minister in London,
Charles Francis Adams. A still broader foreign question grew
out of Mexican affairs, when events culminating in the setting
up of Maximilian of Austria as emperor under protection of
French troops demanded the constant watchfulness of the United
States. Lincoln&rsquo;s course was one of prudent moderation.
France voluntarily declared that she sought in Mexico only
to satisfy injuries done her and not to overthrow or establish
local government or to appropriate territory. The United
States Government replied that, relying on these assurances,
it would maintain strict non-intervention, at the same time
openly avowing the general sympathy of its people with a
Mexican republic, and that &ldquo;their own safety and the cheerful
destiny to which they aspire are intimately dependent on the
continuance of free republican institutions throughout America.&rdquo;
In the early part of 1863 the French Government proposed a
mediation between the North and the South. This offer President
Lincoln (on the 6th of February) declined to consider, Seward
replying for him that it would only be entering into diplomatic
discussion with the rebels whether the authority of the government
should be renounced, and the country delivered over to
disunion and anarchy.</p>

<p>The Civil War gradually grew to dimensions beyond all expectation.
By January 1863 the Union armies numbered near
a million men, and were kept up to this strength till the end of
the struggle. The Federal war debt eventually reached the sum
of $2,700,000,000. The fortunes of battle were somewhat
fluctuating during the first half of 1863, but the beginning of
July brought the Union forces decisive victories. The reduction
of Vicksburg (4th of July) and Port Hudson (9th of July), with
other operations, restored complete control of the Mississippi,
severing the Southern Confederacy. In the east Lee had the
second time marched his army into Pennsylvania to suffer a
disastrous defeat at Gettysburg, on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of July,
though he was able to withdraw his shattered forces south of the
Potomac. At the dedication of this battlefield as a soldiers&rsquo;
cemetery in November, President Lincoln made the following
oration, which has taken permanent place as a classic in American
literature:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in
a great civil war testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives
that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far
above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note
nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honoured dead
we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall
have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In the unexpected prolongation of the war, volunteer enlistments
became too slow to replenish the waste of armies, and in
1863 the government was forced to resort to a draft. The
enforcement of the conscription created much opposition in
various parts of the country, and led to a serious riot in the city
of New York on the 13th-16th of July. President Lincoln
executed the draft with all possible justice and forbearance,
but refused every importunity to postpone it. It was made a
special subject of criticism by the Democratic party of the North,
which was now organizing itself on the basis of a discontinuance
of the war, to endeavour to win the presidential election of
the following year. Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio, having
made a violent public speech at Mt. Vernon, Ohio, on the 1st of
May against the war and military proceedings, was arrested on
the 5th of May by General Burnside, tried by military commission,
and sentenced on the 16th to imprisonment; a writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> had been refused, and the sentence was changed by the
president to transportation beyond the military lines. By way
of political defiance the Democrats of Ohio nominated Vallandigham
for governor on the 11th of June. Prominent Democrats
and a committee of the Convention having appealed for his
release, Lincoln wrote two long letters in reply discussing the
constitutional question, and declaring that in his judgment the
president as commander-in-chief in time of rebellion or invasion
holds the power and responsibility of suspending the privilege of
the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, but offering to release Vallandigham
if the committee would sign a declaration that rebellion exists,
that an army and navy are constitutional means to suppress it,
and that each of them would use his personal power and influence
to prosecute the war. This liberal offer and their refusal to accept
it counteracted all the political capital they hoped to make
out of the case; and public opinion was still more powerfully
influenced in behalf of the president&rsquo;s action, by the pathos of
the query which he propounded in one of his letters: &ldquo;Must I
shoot the simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while I must
not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?&rdquo;
When the election took place in Ohio, Vallandigham was defeated
by a majority of more than a hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Many unfounded rumours of a willingness on the part of the
Confederate States to make peace were circulated to weaken the
Union war spirit. To all such suggestions, up to the time of
issuing his emancipation proclamation, Lincoln announced his
readiness to stop fighting and grant amnesty, whenever they
would submit to and maintain the national authority under the
Constitution of the United States. Certain agents in Canada
having in 1864 intimated that they were empowered to treat for
peace, Lincoln, through Greeley, tendered them safe conduct to
Washington. They were by this forced to confess that they
possessed no authority to negotiate. The president thereupon
sent them, and made public, the following standing offer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="noind">&ldquo;To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any proposition which embraces the restoration of peace, the
integrity of the whole Union, and the abandonment of slavery, and
which comes by and with an authority that can control the armies
now at war against the United States, will be received and considered
by the Executive Government of the United States, and
will be met by liberal terms on substantial and collateral points,
and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.</p>

<p class="noind">&ldquo;July 18, 1864.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="author">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Abraham Lincoln.</span>&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p>A noteworthy conference on this question took place near the
close of the Civil War, when the strength of the Confederacy was
almost exhausted. F. P. Blair, senior, a personal friend of
Jefferson Davis, acting solely on his own responsibility, was
permitted to go from Washington to Richmond, where, on the
12th of January 1865, after a private and unofficial interview,
Davis in writing declared his willingness to enter a conference
&ldquo;to secure peace to the two countries.&rdquo; Report being duly
made to President Lincoln, he wrote a note (dated 18th January)
consenting to receive any agent sent informally &ldquo;with the view
of securing peace to the people of our common country.&rdquo; Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page709" id="page709"></a>709</span>
the basis of this latter proposition three Confederate commissioners
(A. H. Stevens, J. A. C. Campbell and R. M. T. Hunter) finally
came to Hampton Roads, where President Lincoln and Secretary
Seward met them on the U.S. steam transport &ldquo;River Queen,&rdquo;
and on the 3rd of February 1865 an informal conference of four
hours&rsquo; duration was held. Private reports of the interview agree
substantially in the statement that the Confederates proposed a
cessation of the Civil War, and postponement of its issues for
future adjustment, while for the present the belligerents should
unite in a campaign to expel the French from Mexico, and to
enforce the Monroe doctrine. President Lincoln, however,
although he offered to use his influence to secure compensation
by the Federal government to slave-owners for their slaves, if
there should be &ldquo;voluntary abolition of slavery by the states,&rdquo;
a liberal and generous administration of the Confiscation Act,
and the immediate representation of the southern states in
Congress, refused to consider any alliance against the French in
Mexico, and adhered to the instructions he had given Seward
before deciding to personally accompany him. These formulated
three indispensable conditions to adjustment: first, the restoration
of the national authority throughout all the states; second,
no receding by the executive of the United States on the slavery
question; third, no cessation of hostilities short of an end of
the war, and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the government.
These terms the commissioners were not authorized to
accept, and the interview ended without result.</p>

<p>As Lincoln&rsquo;s first presidential term of four years neared its
end, the Democratic party gathered itself for a supreme effort to
regain the ascendancy lost in 1860. The slow progress of the
war, the severe sacrifice of life in campaign and battle, the
enormous accumulation of public debt, arbitrary arrests and
suspension of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the rigour of the draft, and the
proclamation of military emancipation furnished ample subjects
of bitter and vindictive campaign oratory. A partisan coterie
which surrounded M&lsquo;Clellan loudly charged the failure of his
Richmond campaign to official interference in his plans.
Vallandigham had returned to his home in defiance of his banishment
beyond military lines, and was leniently suffered to remain.
The aggressive spirit of the party, however, pushed it to a fatal
extreme. The Democratic National Convention adopted (August
29, 1864) a resolution (drafted by Vallandigham) declaring the
war a failure, and demanding a cessation of hostilities; it
nominated M&lsquo;Clellan for president, and instead of adjourning
<i>sine die</i> as usual, remained organized, and subject to be convened
at any time and place by the executive national committee.
This threatening attitude, in conjunction with alarming
indications of a conspiracy to resist the draft, had the effect to
thoroughly consolidate the war party, which had on the 8th of
June unanimously renominated Lincoln, and had nominated
Andrew Johnson of Tennessee for the vice-presidency. At the
election held on the 8th of November 1864, Lincoln received
2,216,076 of the popular votes, and M&lsquo;Clellan (who had openly
disapproved of the resolution declaring the war a failure) but
1,808,725; while of the presidential electors 212 voted for
Lincoln and 21 for M&lsquo;Clellan. Lincoln&rsquo;s second term of office
began on the 4th of March 1865.</p>

<p>While this political contest was going on the Civil War was
being brought to a decisive close. Grant, at the head of the
Army of the Potomac, followed Lee to Richmond and Petersburg,
and held him in siege to within a few days of final surrender.
General W. T. Sherman, commanding the bulk of the Union
forces in the Mississippi Valley, swept in a victorious march
through the heart of the Confederacy to Savannah on the coast,
and thence northward to North Carolina. Lee evacuated Richmond
on the 2nd of April, and was overtaken by Grant and
compelled to surrender his entire army on the 9th of April 1865.
Sherman pushed Johnston to a surrender on the 26th of April.
This ended the war.</p>

<p>Lincoln being at the time on a visit to the army, entered Richmond
the day after its surrender. Returning to Washington, he
made his last public address on the evening of the 11th of April,
devoted mainly to the question of reconstructing loyal governments
in the conquered states. On the evening of the 14th of
April he attended Ford&rsquo;s theatre in Washington. While seated
with his family and friends absorbed in the play, John Wilkes
Booth, an actor, who with others had prepared a plot to assassinate
the several heads of government, went into the little corridor
leading to the upper stage-box, and secured it against ingress
by a wooden bar. Then stealthily entering the box, he discharged
a pistol at the head of the president from behind, the ball penetrating
the brain. Brandishing a huge knife, with which he wounded
Colonel Rathbone who attempted to hold him, the assassin rushed
through the stage-box to the front and leaped down upon the
stage, escaping behind the scenes and from the rear of the
building, but was pursued, and twelve days afterwards shot in a
barn where he had concealed himself. The wounded president
was borne to a house across the street, where he breathed his
last at 7 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> on the 15th of April 1865.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>President Lincoln was of unusual stature, 6 ft. 4 in., and of spare
but muscular build; he had been in youth remarkably strong and
skilful in the athletic games of the frontier, where, however, his
popularity and recognized impartiality oftener made him an umpire
than a champion. He had regular and prepossessing features,
dark complexion, broad high forehead, prominent cheek bones,
grey deep-set eyes, and bushy black hair, turning to grey at the time
of his death. Abstemious in his habits, he possessed great physical
endurance. He was almost as tender-hearted as a woman. &ldquo;I
have not willingly planted a thorn in any man&rsquo;s bosom,&rdquo; he was
able to say. His patience was inexhaustible. He had naturally a
most cheerful and sunny temper, was highly social and sympathetic,
loved pleasant conversation, wit, anecdote and laughter. Beneath
this, however, ran an undercurrent of sadness; he was occasionally
subject to hours of deep silence and introspection that approached
a condition of trance. In manner he was simple, direct, void of the
least affectation, and entirely free from awkwardness, oddity or
eccentricity. His mental qualities were&mdash;a quick analytic perception,
strong logical powers, a tenacious memory, a liberal estimate
and tolerance of the opinions of others, ready intuition of human
nature; and perhaps his most valuable faculty was rare ability to
divest himself of all feeling or passion in weighing motives of persons
or problems of state. His speech and diction were plain, terse,
forcible. Relating anecdotes with appreciative humour and fascinating
dramatic skill, he used them freely and effectively in
conversation and argument. He loved manliness, truth and justice.
He despised all trickery and selfish greed. In arguments at the bar
he was so fair to his opponent that he frequently appeared to concede
away his client&rsquo;s case. He was ever ready to take blame on himself
and bestow praise on others. &ldquo;I claim not to have controlled events,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&rdquo;
The Declaration of Independence was his political chart and inspiration.
He acknowledged a universal equality of human rights.
&ldquo;Certainly the negro is not our equal in colour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps
not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth
the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every
other man white or black.&rdquo; He had unchanging faith in self-government.
&ldquo;The people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are the rightful masters of
both congresses and courts, not to overthrow the constitution, but
to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution.&rdquo; Yielding and
accommodating in non-essentials, he was inflexibly firm in a principle
or position deliberately taken. &ldquo;Let us have faith that right makes
might,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our
duty as we understand it.&rdquo; The emancipation proclamation once
issued, he reiterated his purpose never to retract or modify it.
&ldquo;There have been men base enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to propose to me
to return to slavery our black warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee,
and thus win the respect of the masters they fought. Should I do
so I should deserve to be damned in time and eternity. Come what
will, I will keep my faith with friend and foe.&rdquo; Benevolence and
forgiveness were the very basis of his character; his world-wide
humanity is aptly embodied in a phrase of his second inaugural:
&ldquo;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&rdquo; His nature was
deeply religious, but he belonged to no denomination.</p>

<p>Lincoln married in Springfield on the 4th of November 1842,
Mary Todd (1818-1882), also a native of Kentucky, who bore
him four sons, of whom the only one to grow up was the eldest,
Robert Todd Lincoln (b. 1843), who graduated at Harvard in
1864, served as a captain on the staff of General Grant in 1865,
was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1867, was secretary of war in
the cabinets of Presidents Garfield and Arthur in 1881-1885,
and United States Minister to Great Britain in 1889-1893, and
was prominently connected with many large corporations,
becoming in 1897 president of the Pullman Co.</p>

<p>Of the many statues of President Lincoln in American cities,
the best known is that, in Chicago, by St Gaudens. Among the

others are two by Thomas Ball, one in statuary hall in the Capitol
at Washington, and one in Boston; two&mdash;one in Rochester,
N.Y., and one in Springfield, Ill.&mdash;by Leonard W. Volk, who
made a life-mask and a bust of Lincoln in 1860; and one by
J. Q. A. Ward, in Lincoln Park, Washington. Francis B.
Carpenter painted in 1864 &ldquo;Lincoln signing the Emancipation
Proclamation,&rdquo; now in the Capitol at Washington.</p>

in Springfield in December 1839. They met repeatedly in the
campaign of 1840. In 1852 Lincoln attempted with little success
to reply to a speech made by Douglas in Richmond. On the 4th
of October 1854 in Springfield, in reply to a speech on the Nebraska
question by Douglas delivered the day before, Lincoln made a
remarkable speech four hours long, to which Douglas replied on
the next day; and in the fortnight immediately following Lincoln
attacked Douglas&rsquo;s record again at Bloomington and at Peoria.
On the 26th of June 1857 Lincoln in a speech at Springfield answered
Douglas&rsquo;s speech of the 12th in which he made over his doctrine of
popular sovereignty to suit the Dred Scott decision. Before the
actual debate in 1858 Douglas made a speech in Chicago on the 9th
of July, to which Lincoln replied the next day; Douglas spoke at
Bloomington on the 16th of July and Lincoln answered him in
Springfield on the 17th.</p>

<p><a name="ft4g" id="ft4g" href="#fa4g"><span class="fn">4</span></a> Without Lincoln&rsquo;s knowledge or consent, the managers of his

<p><a name="ft5g" id="ft5g" href="#fa5g"><span class="fn">5</span></a> In November 1861 the president drafted a bill providing (1)
that all slaves more than thirty-five years old in the state of Delaware
should immediately become free; (2) that all children of slave
parentage born after the passage of the act should be free; (3) that
all others should be free on attaining the age of thirty-five or after
the 1st of January 1893, except for terms of apprenticeship; and
(4) that the national government should pay to the state of Delaware
$23,200 a year for twenty-one years. But this bill, which Lincoln
had hoped would introduce a system of &ldquo;compensated emancipation,&rdquo;
was not approved by the legislature of Delaware, which
considered it in February 1862.</p>

<p><a name="ft6g" id="ft6g" href="#fa6g"><span class="fn">6</span></a> It is to be noted that slavery in the border slave states was not
affected by the proclamation. The parts of Virginia and Louisiana
not affected were those then considered to be under Federal jurisdiction;
in Virginia 55 counties were excepted (including the 48
which became the separate state of West Virginia), and in Louisiana
13 parishes (including the parish of Orleans). As the Federal Government
did not, at the time, actually have jurisdiction over the rest
of the territory of the Confederate States, that really affected, some
writers have questioned whether the proclamation really emancipated
any slaves when it was issued. The proclamation had the most important
political effect in the North of rallying more than ever to the
support of the administration the large anti-slavery element. The
adoption of the 13th amendment to the Federal Constitution in 1865
rendered unnecessary any decision of the U.S. Supreme Court upon
the validity of the proclamation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINCOLN,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a city and county of a city, municipal, county and
parliamentary borough, and the county town of Lincolnshire,
England. Pop. (1901) 48,784. It is picturesquely situated on
the summit and south slope of the limestone ridge of the Cliff
range of hills, which rises from the north bank of the river
Witham, at its confluence with the Foss Dyke, to an altitude of
200 ft. above the river. The cathedral rises majestically from
the crown of the hill, and is a landmark for many miles. Lincoln
is 130 m. N. by W. from London by the Great Northern railway;
it is also served by branches of the Great Eastern, Great Central
and Midland railways.</p>

<p>Lincoln is one of the most interesting cities in England. The
ancient British town occupied the crown of the hill beyond the
Newport or North Gate. The Roman town consisted of two
parallelograms of unequal length, the first extending west from
the Newport gate to a point a little west of the castle keep.
The second parallelogram, added as the town increased in size
and importance, extended due south from this point down the
hill towards the Witham as far as Newland, and thence in a
direction due east as far as Broad Street. Returning thence due
north, it joined the south-east corner of the first and oldest
parallelogram in what was afterwards known as the Minster
yard, and terminated its east side upon its junction with the
north wall in a line with the Newport gate. This is the oldest
part of the town, and is named &ldquo;above hill.&rdquo; After the departure
of the Romans, the city walls were extended still farther in a
south direction across the Witham as far as the great bar gate,
the south entrance to the High Street of the city; the junction
of these walls with the later Roman one was effected immediately
behind Broad Street. The &ldquo;above hill&rdquo; portion of the city
consists of narrow irregular streets, some of which are too steep
to admit of being ascended by carriages. The south portion,
which is named &ldquo;below hill,&rdquo; is much more commodious, and
contains the principal business premises. Here also are the
railway stations.</p>

<p>The glory of Lincoln is the noble cathedral of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, commonly known as the Minster. As a study to
the architect and antiquary this stands unrivalled, not only as
embodying the earliest purely Gothic work extant, but as
containing within its compass every variety of style from the
simple massive Norman of the central west front, and the later
and more ornate examples of that style in the west doorways and
towers; onward through all the Gothic styles, of each of which
both early and late examples appear. The building material is
the oolite and calcareous stone of Lincoln Heath and Haydor,
which has the peculiarity of becoming hardened on the surface
when tooled. Formerly the cathedral had three spires, all of wood
or leaded timber. The spire on the central tower, which would
appear to have been the highest in the world, was blown down in
1547. Those on the two western towers were removed in 1808.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The ground plan of the first church, adopted from that of Rouen,
was laid by Bishop Remigius in 1086, and the church was consecrated
three days after his death, on the 6th of May 1092. The west front
consists of an Early English screen (<i>c.</i> 1225) thrown over the Norman
front, the west towers rising behind it. The earliest Norman work is
part of that of Remigius; the great portals and the west towers
up to the third storey are Norman <i>c.</i> 1148. The upper parts of
them date from 1365. Perpendicular windows (<i>c.</i> 1450) are inserted.
The nave and aisles were completed <i>c.</i> 1220. The transepts mainly
built between 1186 and 1235 have two fine rose windows, that in
the N. is Early English, and that in the S. Decorated. The first
has beautiful contemporary stained glass. These are called respectively
the Dean&rsquo;s Eye and Bishop&rsquo;s Eye. A Galilee of rich
Early English work forms the entrance of the S. transept. Of the
choir the western portion known as St Hugh&rsquo;s (1186-1204) is the
famous first example of pointed work; the eastern, called the
Angel Choir, is a magnificently ornate work completed in 1280.
Fine Perpendicular canopied stalls fill the western part. The great
east window, 57 ft. in height, is an example of transition from Early
English to Decorated <i>c.</i> 1288. Other noteworthy features of the
interior are the Easter sepulchre (<i>c.</i> 1300), the foliage ornamentation
of which is beautifully natural; and the organ screen of a somewhat
earlier date. The great central tower is Early English as far as the
first storey, the continuation dates from 1307. The total height is
271 ft.; and the tower contains the bell, Great Tom of Lincoln,
weighing over 5 tons. The dimensions of the cathedral internally
are&mdash;nave, 252 × 79.6 × 80 ft.; choir, 158 × 82 × 72 ft.; angel
choir, which includes presbytery and lady chapel, 166 × 44 × 72 ft.;
main transept, 220 × 63 × 74 ft.; choir transept, 166 × 44 × 72 ft.
The west towers are 206 ft. high.</p>

<p>The buildings of the close that call for notice are the chapter-house
of ten sides, 60 ft. diameter, 42 ft. high, with a fine vestibule
of the same height, built <i>c.</i> 1225, and therefore the earliest of English
polygonal chapter-houses, and the library, a building of 1675, which
contains a small museum. The picturesque episcopal palace contains
work of the date of St Hugh, and the great hall is mainly
Early English. There is some Decorated work, and much Perpendicular,
including the gateway. It fell into disuse after the Reformation,
but by extensive restoration was brought back to its proper
use at the end of the 19th century. Among the most famous bishops
were St Hugh of Avalon (1186-1200); Robert Grosseteste (1235-1253);
Richard Flemming (1420-1431), founder of Lincoln College,
Oxford; William Smith (1495-1514), founder of Brasenose College,
Oxford; William Wake (1705-1716); and Edmund Gibson (1716-1723).
Every stall has produced a prelate or cardinal. The see
covers almost the whole of the county, with very small portions of
Norfolk and Yorkshire, and it included Nottinghamshire until the
formation of the bishopric of Southwell in 1884. At its earliest
formation, when Remigius, almoner of the abbey of Fécamp, removed
the seat of the bishopric here from Dorchester in Oxfordshire
shortly after the Conquest, it extended from the Humber to the
Thames, eastward beyond Cambridge, and westward beyond
Leicester. It was reduced, however, by the formation of the sees
of Ely, Peterborough and Oxford, and by the rearrangement of
diocesan boundaries in 1837.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page711" id="page711"></a>711</span></p>

<p>The remains of Roman Lincoln are of the highest interest.
The Newport Arch or northern gate of <i>Lindum</i> is one of the most
perfect specimens of Roman architecture in England. It consists
of a great arch flanked by two smaller arches, of which one
remains. The Roman Ermine Street runs through it, leading
northward almost in a straight line to the Humber. Fragments
of the town wall remain at various points; a large quantity of
coins and other relics have been discovered; and remains of a
burial-place and buildings unearthed. Of these last the most
important is the series of column-bases, probably belonging to a
Basilica, beneath a house in the street called Bail Gate, adjacent
to the Newport Arch. A villa in Greetwell; a tesselated pavement,
a milestone and other relics in the cloister; an altar unearthed
at the church of St Swithin, are among many other
discoveries. Among churches, apart from the minster, two of
outstanding interest are those of St Mary-le-Wigford and St
Peter-at-Gowts (<i>i.e.</i> sluice-gates), both in the lower part of High
Street. Their towers, closely similar, are fine examples of
perhaps very early Norman work, though they actually possess
the characteristics of pre-Conquest workmanship. Bracebridge
church shows similar early work; but as a whole the churches of
Lincoln show plainly the results of the siege of 1644, and such
buildings as St Botolph&rsquo;s, St Peter&rsquo;s-at-Arches and St Martin&rsquo;s
are of the period 1720-1740. Several churches are modern
buildings on ancient sites. There were formerly three small
priories, five friaries and four hospitals in or near Lincoln. The
preponderance of friaries over priories of monks is explained by
the fact that the cathedral was served by secular canons. Bishop
Grosseteste was the devoted patron of the friars, particularly the
Franciscans, who were always in their day the town missionaries.
The Greyfriars, near St Swithin&rsquo;s church, is a picturesque two-storied
building of the 13th century. Lincoln is rich in early
domestic architecture. The building known as John of Gaunt&rsquo;s
stables, actually St Mary&rsquo;s Guild Hall, is of two storeys, with
rich Norman doorway and moulding. The Jews&rsquo; House is another
fine example of 12th-century building; and Norman remains
appear in several other houses, such as Deloraine Court and the
House of Aaron the Jew. Lincoln Castle, lying W. of the
cathedral, was newly founded by William the Conqueror when
Remigius decided to found his minster under its protection.
The site, with its artificial mounds, is of much earlier, probably
British, date. There are Norman remains in the Gateway
Tower; parts of the walls are of this period, and the keep dates
from the middle of the 12th century. Among medieval gateways,
the Exchequer Gate, serving as the finance-office of the chapter,
is a fine specimen of 13th-century work. Pottergate is of the
14th century, and Stonebow in High Street of the 15th, with
the Guildhall above it. St Dunstan&rsquo;s Lock is the name, corrupted
from Dunestall, now applied to the entrance to the street where
a Jewish quarter was situated; here lived the Christian boy
afterwards known as &ldquo;little St Hugh,&rdquo; who was asserted to have
been crucified by the Jews in 1255. His shrine remains in the
S. choir aisle of the minster. Other antiquities are the Perpendicular
conduit of St Mary in High Street and the High
Bridge, carrying High Street over the Witham, which is almost
unique in England as retaining some of the old houses upon it.</p>

<p>Among modern public buildings are the county hall, old and
new corn exchanges and public library. Educational establishments
include a grammar school, a girls&rsquo; high school, a science
and art school and a theological college. The arboretum in
Monks Road is the principal pleasure-ground; and there is a
race-course. The principal industry is the manufacture of
agricultural machinery and implements; there are also iron
foundries and maltings, and a large trade in corn and agricultural
produce. The parliamentary borough, returning one member,
falls between the Gainsborough division of the county on the N.,
and that of Sleaford on the S. Area, 3755 acres.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The British Lindun, which, according to the
geography of Claudius Ptolemaeus, was the chief town of the
Coritani, was probably the nucleus of the Roman town of Lindum.
This was at first a Roman legionary fortress, and on the removal
of the troops northward was converted into a municipality with
the title of <i>colonia</i>. Such important structural remains as
have been described attest the rank and importance of the place,
which, however, did not attain a very great size. Its bishop
attended the council of Arles in 314, and Lincoln (<i>Lindocolina</i>,
<i>Lincolle</i>, <i>Nicole</i>) is mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus
written about 320. Although said to have been captured by
Hengest in 475 and recovered by Ambrosius in the following
year, the next authentic mention of the city is Bede&rsquo;s record
that Paulinus preached in Lindsey in 628 and built a stone
church at Lincoln in which he consecrated Honorius archbishop
of Canterbury. During their inroads into Mercia, the Danes
in 877 established themselves at Lincoln, which was one of the
five boroughs recovered by King Edmund in 941. A mint
established here in the reign of Alfred was maintained until the
reign of Edward I. (Mint Street turning from High Street near
the Stonebow recalls its existence.) At the time of the Domesday
Survey Lincoln was governed by twelve Lawmen, relics of Danish
rule, each with hereditable franchises of sac and soc. Whereas
it had rendered £20 annually to King Edward, and £10 to the
earl, it then rendered £100. There had been 1150 houses, but
240 had been destroyed since the time of King Edward. Of
these 166 had suffered by the raising of the castle by William I.
in 1068 partly on the site of the Roman camp. The strength
of the position of the castle brought much fighting on Lincoln.
In 1141 King Stephen regained both castle and city from the
empress Maud, but was attacked and captured in the same year
at the &ldquo;Joust of Lincoln.&rdquo; In 1144 he besieged the castle,
held by the earl of Chester, and recovered it as a pledge in 1146.
In 1101 it was held by Gerard de Camville for Prince John and
was besieged by William Longchamp, Richard&rsquo;s chancellor,
in vain; in 1210 it stood a siege by the partisans of the French
prince Louis, who were defeated at the battle called Lincoln
Fair on the 19th of May 1217. Granted by Henry III. to William
Longepée, earl of Salisbury, in 1224, the castle descended by
the marriage of his descendant Alice to Thomas Plantagenet,
and became part of the duchy of Lancaster.</p>

<p>In 1157 Henry II. gave the citizens their first charter, granting
them the city at a fee-farm rent and all the liberties which they
had had under William II., with their gild merchant for themselves
and the men of the county as they had then. In 1200
the citizens obtained release from all but pleas of the Crown
without the walls, and pleas of external tenure, and were
given the pleas of the Crown within the city according to the
customs of the city of London, on which those of Lincoln were
modelled. The charter also gave them quittance of toll and
lastage throughout the kingdom, and of certain other dues.
In 1210 the citizens owed the exchequer £100 for the privilege
of having a mayor, but the office was abolished by Henry III.
and by Edward I. in 1290, though restored by the charter of
1300. In 1275 the citizens claimed the return of writs, assize
of bread and ale and other royal rights, and in 1301 Edward I.,
when confirming the previous charters, gave them quittance of
murage, pannage, pontage and other dues. The mayor and
citizens were given criminal jurisdiction in 1327, when the
burghmanmot held weekly in the gildhall since 1272 by the
mayor and bailiffs was ordered to hear all local pleas which led
to friction with the judges of assize. The city became a separate
county by charter of 1409, when it was decreed that the bailiffs
should henceforth be sheriffs and the mayor the king&rsquo;s escheator,
and the mayor and sheriffs with four others justices of the peace
with defined jurisdiction. As the result of numerous complaints
of inability to pay the fee-farm rent of £180 Edward IV. enlarged
the bounds of the city in 1466, while Henry VIII. in 1546 gave
the citizens four advowsons, and possibly also in consequence
of declining trade the city markets were made free of tolls in
1554. Incorporated by Charles I. in 1628 under a common
council with 13 aldermen, 4 coroners and other officers, Lincoln
surrendered its charters in 1684, but the first charter was
restored after the Revolution, and was in force till 1834.</p>

<p>Parliaments were held at Lincoln in 1301, 1316 and 1327,
and the city returned two burgesses from 1295 to 1885, when
it lost one member. After the 13th century the chief interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page712" id="page712"></a>712</span>
of Lincoln were ecclesiastical and commercial. As early as
1103 Odericus declared that a rich citizen of Lincoln kept the
treasure of King Magnus of Norway, supplying him with all he
required, and there is other evidence of intercourse with Scandinavia.
There was an important Jewish colony, Aaron of Lincoln
being one of the most influential financiers in the kingdom
between 1166 and 1186. It was probably jealousy of their
wealth that brought the charge of the crucifixion of &ldquo;little
St Hugh&rdquo; in 1255 upon the Jewish community. Made a staple
of wool, leather and skins in 1291, famous for its scarlet cloth
in the 13th century, Lincoln had a few years of great prosperity,
but with the transference of the staple to Boston early in the
reign of Edward III., its trade began to decrease. The craft
gilds remained important until after the Reformation, a pageant
still being held in 1566. The fair now held during the last whole
week of April would seem to be identical with that granted by
Charles II. in 1684. Edward III. authorized a fair from St
Botolph&rsquo;s day to the feast of SS Peter and Paul in 1327, and
William III. gave one for the first Wednesday in September
in 1696, while the present November fair is, perhaps, a survival
of that granted by Henry IV. in 1409 for fifteen days before the
feast of the Deposition of St Hugh.</p>

Illinois, U.S.A., in the N. central part of the state, 156 m. S.W.
of Chicago, and about 28 m. N.E. of Springfield. Pop. (1900)
8962, of whom 940 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 10,892.
It is served by the Illinois Central and the Chicago &amp; Alton
railways and by the Illinois Traction Interurban Electric line.
The city is the seat of the state asylum for feeble-minded
children (established at Jacksonville in 1865 and removed to
Lincoln in 1878), and of Lincoln College (Presbyterian) founded
in 1865. There are also an orphans&rsquo; home, supported by the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and a Carnegie library.
The old court-house in which Abraham Lincoln often practised
is still standing. Lincoln is situated in a productive grain region,
and has valuable coal mines. The value of the factory products
increased from $375,167 in 1900 to $784,248 in 1905, or 109%.
The first settlement on the site of Lincoln was made in 1835,
and the city was first chartered in 1857.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINCOLN,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a city of S.E. Nebraska, U.S.A., county-seat of
Lancaster county and capital of the state. Pop. (1900) 40,169
(5297 being foreign-born); (1910 census) 43,973. It is served by
the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific, the Union Pacific, the Missouri Pacific and the Chicago &amp;
North-Western railways. Lincoln is one of the most attractive
residential cities of the Middle West. Salt Creek, an affluent of the
Platte river, skirts the city. On this side the city has repeatedly
suffered from floods. The principal buildings include a state
capitol (built 1883-1889); a city-hall, formerly the U.S. government
building (1874-1879); a county court-house; a federal
building (1904-1906); a Carnegie library (1902); a hospital
for crippled children (1905) and a home for the friendless,
both supported by the state; a state penitentiary and asylum
for the insane, both in the suburbs; and the university of
Nebraska. In the suburbs there are three denominational
schools, the Nebraska Wesleyan University (Methodist Episcopal,
1888) at University Place; Union College (Seventh Day Adventists,
1891) at College View; and Cotner University (Disciples
of Christ, 1889, incorporated as the Nebraska Christian University)
at Bethany. Just outside the city limits are the state
fair grounds, where a state fair is held annually. Lincoln is the
see of a Roman Catholic bishopric. The surrounding country is
a beautiful farming region, but its immediate W. environs
are predominantly bare and desolate salt-basins. Lincoln&rsquo;s
&ldquo;factory&rdquo; product increased from $2,763,484 in 1900 to
$5,222,620 in 1905, or 89%, the product for 1905 being 3.4%
of the total for the state. The municipality owns and operates
its electric-lighting plant and water-works.</p>

<p>The salt-springs attracted the first permanent settlers to the
site of Lincoln in 1856, and settlers and freighters came long
distances to reduce the brine or to scrape up the dry-weather
surface deposits. In 1886-1887 the state sank a test-well
2463 ft. deep, which discredited any hope of a great underground
flow or deposit. Scarcely any use is made of the salt waters
locally. Lancaster county was organized extra-legally in 1859,
and under legislative act in 1864; Lancaster village was platted
and became the county-seat in 1864 (never being incorporated);
and in 1867, when it contained five or six houses, its site was
selected for the state capital after a hard-fought struggle between
different sections of the state (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nebraska</a></span>).<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The new city
was incorporated as Lincoln (and formally declared the county-seat
by the legislature) in 1869, and was chartered for the first
time as a city of the second class in 1871; since then its charter
has been repeatedly altered. After 1887 it was a city of the first
class, and after 1889 the only member of the highest subdivision
in that class. After a &ldquo;reform&rdquo; political campaign, the ousting
in 1887 of a corrupt police judge by the mayor and city council,
in defiance of an injunction of a federal court, led to a decision
of the U.S. Supreme Court, favourable to the city authorities
and important in questions of American municipal government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINCOLN JUDGMENT, THE.<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> In this celebrated English
ecclesiastical suit, the bishop of Lincoln (Edward King, <i>q.v.</i>) was
cited before his metropolitan, the archbishop of Canterbury
(Dr Benson), to answer charges of various ritual offences committed
at the administration of Holy Communion in the church
of St Peter at Gowts, in the diocese of Lincoln, on the 4th of
December 1887, and in Lincoln cathedral on the 10th of December
1887. The promoters were Ernest de Lacy Read, William
Brown, Felix Thomas Wilson and John Marshall, all inhabitants
of the diocese of Lincoln, and the last two parishioners of St
Peter at Gowts. The case has a permanent importance in two
respects. First, certain disputed questions of ritual were legally
decided. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury
alone to try one of his suffragan bishops for alleged ecclesiastical
offences was considered and judicially declared to be well
founded both by the judicial committee of privy council and by
the archbishop of Canterbury with the concurrence of his
assessors. The proceedings were begun on the 2nd of June 1888
by a petition presented by the promoters to the archbishop,
praying that a citation to the bishop of Lincoln might issue
calling on him to answer certain ritual charges. On the 26th of
June 1888 the archbishop, by letter, declined to issue citation,
on the ground that until instructed by a competent court as to
his jurisdiction, he was not clear that he had it. The promoters
appealed to the judicial committee of the privy council, to which
an appeal lies under 25 Henry VIII. c. 19 for &ldquo;lack of justice&rdquo;
in the archbishop&rsquo;s court. The matter was heard on the 20th
of July 1888, and on the 8th of August 1888 the committee
decided (i.) that an appeal lay from the refusal of the archbishop
to the judicial committee, and (ii.) that the archbishop
had jurisdiction to issue a citation to the bishop of Lincoln and
to hear the promoters&rsquo; complaint, but they abstained from
expressing an opinion as to whether the archbishop had a discretion
to refuse citation&mdash;whether, in fact, he had any power of
&ldquo;veto&rdquo; over the prosecution. The case being thus remitted
to the archbishop, he decided to entertain it, and on the 4th of
January 1889 issued a citation to the bishop of Lincoln.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February 1889 the archbishop of Canterbury
sat in Lambeth Palace Library, accompanied by the bishops of
London (Dr Temple), Winchester (Dr Harold Browne), Oxford
(Dr Stubbs) and Salisbury (Dr Wordsworth), and the vicar-general
(Sir J. Parker Deane) as assessors. The bishop of Lincoln
appeared in person and read a &ldquo;Protest&rdquo; to the archbishop&rsquo;s
jurisdiction to try him except in a court composed of the archbishop
and all the bishops of the province as judges. The court
adjourned in order that the question of jurisdiction might be
argued. On the 11th of May the archbishop gave judgment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page713" id="page713"></a>713</span>
the effect that whether sitting alone or with assessors he had
jurisdiction to entertain the charge. On the 23rd and 24th of
July 1889 a further preliminary objection raised by the bishop
of Lincoln&rsquo;s counsel was argued. The offences alleged against
the bishop of Lincoln were largely breaches of various rubrics
in the communion service of the Prayer Book which give directions
to the &ldquo;minister.&rdquo; These rubrics are by the Acts of
Uniformity (1 Elizabeth c. 2, and 13 &amp; 14 Car. II. c. 4) made
legally binding. But it was argued that a bishop is not a
&ldquo;minister&rdquo; so as to be bound by the rubrics. The archbishop,
however, held otherwise, and the assessors (except the bishop of
Salisbury, who dissented) concurred in this decision. At this and
subsequent hearings the bishop of Hereford (Dr Atlay) took the
place of the bishop of Winchester as an assessor, and the bishop
of Rochester (Dr Thorold), originally appointed an assessor, but
absent from England at the outset, was present.</p>

<p>The case was heard on its merits in February 1890, before the
archbishop and all the assessors, and the archbishop delivered
his judgment on the 21st of November 1890. The
alleged offences were eight in number. No facts were
<span class="sidenote">Charges and decisions.</span>
in dispute, but only the legality of the various matters
complained of. I. The bishop was charged with
having mixed water with wine in the chalice during the communion
service, and II. with having administered the chalice
so mixed to the communicants. It was decided that the mixing
of the water with the wine during service was illegal, because
an additional ceremony not enjoined in the Prayer Book, but
that the administration of the mixed chalice, the mixing having
been effected before service, was in accordance with primitive
practice and not forbidden in the Church of England. III. The
bishop was charged with the ceremonial washing of the vessels
used for the holy communion, and with drinking the water used
for these ablutions. It was decided that the bishop had committed
no offence, and that what he had done was a reasonable
compliance with the requirement of the rubric that any of the
consecrated elements left over at the end of the celebration
should be then and there consumed. IV. The bishop was charged
with taking the eastward position (<i>i.e.</i> standing at the west
side of the holy table with his face to the east and his back to
the congregation) during the ante-communion service (<i>i.e.</i> the
part of the communion service prior to the consecration prayer).
The rubric requires the celebrant to stand at the north side of
the table. A vast amount of research convinced the archbishop
that this is an intentionally ambiguous phrase which may with
equal accuracy be applied to the north end of the table as now
arranged in churches, and to the long side of the table, which,
in Edward VI.&rsquo;s reign, was often placed lengthwise down the
church, so that the long sides would face north and south.
It was therefore decided (one of the assessors dissenting) that
both positions are legal, and that the bishop had not offended
in adopting the eastward position. V. The bishop was charged
with so standing during the consecration prayer that the &ldquo;Manual
Acts&rdquo; of consecration were invisible to the people gathered round.
It should be stated that the courts (see <i>Ridsdale</i> v. <i>Clifton</i>,
L.R. 1 P.D. 316; 2 P.D. 276) had already decided that the
eastward position during the consecration prayer was legal,
but that it must not be so used by the celebrant as to conceal
the &ldquo;Manual Acts.&rdquo; The archbishop held that the bishop of
Lincoln had transgressed the law in this particular. VI. The
bishop was charged with having, during the celebration of holy
communion, allowed two candles to be alight on a shelf or retable
behind the altar when they were not necessary for giving light.
The archbishop decided that the mere presence of two altar
candles burning during the service, but lit before it began,
was lawful under the First Prayer Book of Edward VI., and
has never been made unlawful, and, therefore, that the bishop
was justified in what he had done. VII. The bishop was charged
with having permitted the hymn known as <i>Agnus Dei</i> to be sung
immediately after the consecration of the elements at a celebration
of the holy communion. The archbishop decided that the
use of hymns in divine service was too firmly established to be
legally questioned, and that there was nothing to differentiate
the use of this particular hymn at this point of the service from
the use of other hymns on other occasions in public worship.
VIII. The bishop was charged with making the sign of the Cross
in the air with his hand in the benediction and at other times
during divine service. The archbishop held that these crossings
were ceremonies not enjoined and, therefore, illegal. The judgment
confined itself to the legal declarations here summarized,
and pronounced no monition or other sentence on the
bishop of Lincoln in respect of the matters in which he
appeared to have committed breaches of the ecclesiastical
law.</p>

<p>The promoters appealed to the judicial committee. The bishop
did not appear on the appeal, which was therefore argued on
the side of the promoters only. The appeal was heard in June
and July 1891, before Lords Halsbury, Hobhouse, Esher,
Herschell, Hannen and Shand and Sir Richard Couch, with
the bishop of Chichester (Dr Durnford), the bishop of St Davids
(Dr Basil Jones) and the bishop of Lichfield (Dr Maclagan) as
episcopal assessors. The points appealed were those above
numbered II., III., IV., VI., VII. Judgment was given on the
2nd of August 1892, and the appeal failed on all points. As to
II., III., IV., and VII. the Committee agreed with the archbishop.
As to VI. (altar lights) they held that, as it was not
shown that the bishop was responsible for the presence of
lighted candles, the charge could not be sustained against him,
and so dismissed it without considering the general question of
the lawfulness of altar lights. They also held that the archbishop
was within his right in pronouncing no sentence against
the bishop, who, it should be added, conformed his practice to
the judgment from the date of its delivery.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINCOLNSHIRE,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> an eastern county of England, bounded N.
by the Humber, E. by the German Ocean and the Wash, S.E.
for 3 m. by Norfolk, S. by Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire,
S.W. by Rutland, W. by Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire
and N.W. by Yorkshire. The area is 2646 sq. m., the county
being second to Yorkshire of the English counties in size.</p>

<p>The coast-line, about 110 m. in length, including the Humber
shore, is generally low and marshy, and artificial banks for guarding
against the inroads of the sea are to be found, in places,
all along the coast. From Grimsby to Skegness traces of a submarine
forest are visible; but while the sea is encroaching upon
some parts of the coast it is receding from others, as shown by
Holbeach, which is now 6 m. from the sea. Several thousand
acres have been reclaimed from this part of the Wash, and round
the mouth of the Nene on the south-east. The deep bay between
the coasts of Lincolnshire and Norfolk, called the Wash, is full
of dangerous sandbanks and silt; the navigable portion off the
Lincolnshire coast is known as the Boston Deeps. The rapidity
of the tides in this inlet, and the lowness of its shores, which are
generally indistinct on account of mist from a moderate offing,
render this the most difficult portion of the navigation of the
east coast of England. On some parts of the coast there are
fine stretches of sand, and Cleethorpes, Skegness, Mablethorpe
and Sutton-on-Sea are favourite resorts for visitors.</p>

<p>The surface of Lincolnshire is generally a large plain, small
portions of which are slightly below the level of the sea. The
south-east parts are perfectly flat; and about one-third of the
county consists of fens and marshes, intersected in all directions
by artificial drains, called locally dykes, delphs, drains, becks,
leams and eaux. This flat surface is broken by two ranges of
calcareous hills running north and south through the county,
and known as the Lincoln Edge or Heights, or the Cliff, and the
Wolds. The former range, on the west, runs nearly due north
from Grantham to Lincoln, and thence to the Humber, traversing
the Heaths of Lincolnshire, which were formerly open moors,
rabbit warrens and sheep walks, but are now enclosed and
brought into high cultivation. The Wolds form a ridge of bold
hills extending from Spilsby to Barton-on-Humber for about
40 m., with an average breadth of about 8 m. The Humber
separates Lincolnshire from Yorkshire. Its ports on the Lincolnshire
side are the small ferry-ports of Barton and New Holland,
and the important harbour of Grimsby. The Trent forms part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page714" id="page714"></a>714</span>
of the boundary with Nottinghamshire, divides the Isle of
Axholme (<i>q.v.</i>) from the district of Lindsey, and falls into the
Humber about 30 m. below Gainsborough. The Witham rises
on the S.W. border of the county, flows north past Grantham
to Lincoln, and thence E. and S.E. to Boston, after a course of
about 80 m. The Welland rises in north-west Northamptonshire,
enters the county at Stamford, and, after receiving the Glen,
flows through an artificial channel into the Fosdyke Wash.
The Nene on the south-east has but a small portion of its course
in Lincolnshire; it flows due north through an artificial outfall,
called the Wisbech Cut. Between the Wolds and the sea lie
the Marshes, a level tract of rich alluvial soil extending from
Barton-on-Humber to Wainfleet, varying in breadth from 5 to
10 m. Between the Welland and the Nene in the south-east of
the county are Gedney Marsh, Holbeach Marsh, Moulton Marsh
and Sutton Marsh.</p>

<p>The Fens (<i>q.v.</i>), the soil of which has been formed partly by
tidal action and partly by the decay of forests, occupy the Isle
of Axholme on the north-west, the vale of Ancholme on the north,
and most of the country south-east of Lincoln. The chief of
these are the Holland, Wildmore, West and East Fens draining
into the Witham; and the Deeping, Bourn, Great Porsand,
and Whaplode Fens draining into the Welland.</p>

<p>The low lands adjoining the tidal reaches of the Trent and
Humber, and part of those around the Wash have been raised
above the natural level and enriched by the process of warping,
which consists in letting the tide run over the land, and retaining
it there a sufficient time to permit the deposit of the sand and
mud held in solution by the waters.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The geological formations for the most part extend in
parallel belts, nearly in the line of the length of the county, from
north to south, and succeed one another in ascending order from
west to east. The lowest is the Triassic Keuper found in the Isle of
Axholme and the valley of the Trent in the form of marls, sandstone
and gypsum. Fish scales and teeth, with bones and footprints
of the <i>Labyrinthodon</i>, are met with in the sandstone. The
red clay is frequently dug for brick-making. The beds dip gently
towards the east. At the junction between the Trias and Lias are
series of beds termed Rhaetics, which seem to mark a transition from
one to the other. These belts are in part exposed in pits near
Newark, and extend north by Gainsborough to where the Trent
flows into the Humber, passing thence into Yorkshire. The characteristic
shells are found at Lea, 2 m. south of Gainsborough, with
a thin bone-bed full of fish teeth and scales. The Lower Lias comes
next in order, with a valuable bed of ironstone now largely worked.
This bed is about 27 ft. in thickness, and crops out at Scunthorpe
and Frodingham, where the workings are open and shallow. The
Middle Lias, which enters the county near Woolsthorpe, is about
20 or 30 ft. thick, and is very variable both in thickness and mineralogical
character; the iron ores of Denton and Caythorpe belong to
this horizon. The Upper Lias enters the county at Stainby, passing
by Grantham and Lincoln where it is worked for bricks. The Lias
thus occupies a vale about 8 or 10 m. in width in the south, narrowing
until on the Humber it is about a mile in width. To this succeed the
Oolite formations. The Inferior Oolite, somewhat narrower than
the Lias, extends from the boundary with Rutland due north past
Lincoln to the vicinity of the Humber; it forms the Cliff of Lincolnshire
with a strong escarpment facing westward. At Lincoln the
ridge is notched by the river Witham. The principal member of
the Inferior Oolite is the Lincolnshire limestone, which is an important
water-bearing bed and is quarried at Lincoln, Ponton, Ancaster, and
Kirton Lindsey for building stone. Eastward of the Inferior Oolite
lie the narrow outcrops of the Great Oolite and Cornbrash. The
Middle Oolite, Oxford clay and Corallian is very narrow in the
south near Wilsthorpe, widening gradually about Sleaford. It then
proceeds north from Lincoln with decreasing width to the vicinity
of the Humber. The Upper Oolite, Kimeridge clay, starts from the
vicinity of Stamford, and after attaining its greatest width near
Horncastle, runs north-north-west to the Humber. The Kimeridge
clay is succeeded by the Spilsby sandstone, Tealby limestone,
Claxby ironstone, and carstone which represent the highest Jurassic
and lowest Cretaceous rocks. In the Cretaceous system of the
Wolds, the Lower Greensand runs nearly parallel with the Upper
Oolite past South Willingham to the Humber. The Upper Greensand
and Gault, represented in Lincolnshire by the Red Chalk, run
north-west from Irby, widening out as far as Kelstern on the east,
and cross the Humber. The Chalk formation, about equal in
breadth to the three preceding, extends from Burgh across the
Humber. The rest of the county, comprising all its south-east
portions between the Middle Oolite belt and the sea, all its north-east
portions between the chalk belt and the sea, and a narrow
tract up the course of the Ancholme river, consists of alluvial
deposits or of reclaimed marsh. In the northern part boulder clay
and glacial sands cover considerable tracts of the older rocks.
Bunter, Permian, and Coal Measure strata have been revealed by
boring to underlie the Keuper near Haxey.</p>

<p>Gypsum is dug in the Isle of Axholme, whiting is made from the
chalk near the shores of the Humber, and lime is made on the
Wolds. Freestone is quarried around Ancaster, and good oolite
building stone is quarried near Lincoln and other places. Ironstone
is worked at several places and there are some blast furnaces.</p>

<p>At Woodhall Spa on the Horncastle branch railway there is a
much-frequented bromine and iodine spring.</p>

<p><i>Climate, Soil and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The climate of the higher grounds
is healthy, and meteorological observation does not justify the
reputation for cold and damp often given to the county as a whole.
The soils vary considerably, according to the geological formations;
ten or twelve different kinds may be found in going across the
country from east to west. A good sandy loam is common in the
Heath division; a sandy loam with chalk, or a flinty loam on chalk
marl, abounds on portions of the Wolds; an argillaceous sand,
merging into rich loam, lies on other portions of the Wolds; a black
loam and a rich vegetable mould cover most of the Isle of Axholme
on the north-west; a well-reclaimed marine marsh, a rich brown
loam, and a stiff cold clay variously occupy the low tracts along the
Humber, and between the north Wolds and the sea; a peat earth,
a deep sandy loam, and a rich soapy blue clay occupy most of the
east and south Fens; and an artificial soil, obtained by &ldquo;warping,&rdquo;
occupies considerable low strips of land along the tidal reaches of
the rivers.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire is one of the principal agricultural, especially grain-producing,
counties in England. Nearly nine-tenths of the total
area is under cultivation. The wide grazing lands have long been
famous, and the arable lands are specially adapted for the growth
of wheat and beans. The largest individual grain-crop, however, is
barley. Both cattle and sheep are bred in great numbers. The
cattle raised are the Shorthorns and improved Lincolnshire breeds.
The dairy, except in the vicinity of large towns, receives little
attention. The sheep are chiefly of the Lincolnshire and large
Leicestershire breeds, and go to the markets of Yorkshire and
London. Lincolnshire has long been famous for a fine breed of
horses both for the saddle and draught. Horse fairs are held every
year at Horncastle and Lincoln. Large flocks of geese were formerly
kept in the Fens, but their number has been diminished since the
drainage of these parts. Where a large number of them were bred,
nests were constructed for them one above another; they were
daily taken down by the gooseherd, driven to the water, and then
reinstated in their nests, without a single bird being misplaced.
Decoys were once numerous in the undrained state of the Fens.</p>

<p><i>Industries and Communications.</i>&mdash;Manufactures are few and,
relatively to the agricultural industry, small. The mineral industries,
however, are of value, and there are considerable agricultural
machine and implement factories at Lincoln, Boston, Gainsborough,
Grantham and Louth. At Little Bytham a very hard
brick, called adamantine clinker, is made of the siliceous clay that
the Romans used for similar works. Bone-crushing, tanning, the
manufacture of oil-cake for cattle, and rope-making are carried on
in various places. Grimsby is an important port both for continental
traffic and especially for fisheries; Boston is second to it in the
county; and Gainsborough has a considerable traffic on the Trent.
Sutton Bridge is a lesser port on the Wash.</p>

<p>The principal railway is the Great Northern, its main line touching
the county in the S.W. and serving Grantham. Its principal
branches are from Peterborough to Spalding, Boston, Louth and
Grimsby; and from Grantham to Sleaford and Boston, and to
Lincoln, and Boston to Lincoln. This company works jointly with
the Great Eastern the line from March to Spalding, Lincoln, Gainsborough
and Doncaster, and with the Midland that from Saxby to
Bourn, Spalding, Holbeach, Sutton Bridge and King&rsquo;s Lynn.
The Midland company has a branch from Newark to Lincoln, and
the Lancashire, Derbyshire, and East Coast line terminates at
Lincoln. The Great Central railway connects the west, Sheffield
and Doncaster with Grimsby, and with Hull by ferry from New
Holland. Canals connect Louth with the Humber, Sleaford with the
Witham, and Grantham with the Trent near Nottingham; but the
greater rivers and many of the drainage cuts are navigable, being
artificially deepened and embanked.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient county
is 1,693,550 acres, with a population in 1891 of 472,878 and in 1901
of 498,847. The primary divisions are three trithings or Ridings
(<i>q.v.</i>). The north division is called the Parts of Lindsey, the south-west
the Parts of Kesteven, and the south-east the Parts of Holland.
Each of these divisions had in early times its own reeve or gerefa.
Each constitutes an administrative county, the Parts of Lindsey
having an area of 967,689 acres; Kesteven, 465,877 acres; and
Holland, 262,766 acres. The Parts of Lindsey contain 17 wapentakes;
Kesteven, exclusive of the soke and borough of Grantham
and the borough of Stamford, 9 wapentakes; and Holland, 3 wapentakes.
The municipal boroughs and urban districts are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Parts of Lindsey.</span>&mdash;Municipal boroughs&mdash;Grimsby, a county
borough (pop. 63,138), Lincoln, a city and county borough and the

Urban districts&mdash;Holbeach (4755), Long Sutton (2524), Spalding
(9385), Sutton Bridge (2105). In the Parts of Holland the borough
of Boston has a separate commission of the peace and there are
two petty sessional divisions. Lincolnshire is in the Midland circuit.
In the Parts of Kesteven the boroughs of Grantham and Stamford
have each a separate commission of the peace and separate courts
of quarter sessions, and there are 4 petty sessional divisions. In the
Parts of Lindsey the county boroughs of Grimsby and Lincoln have
each a separate commission of the peace and a separate court of
quarter sessions, while the municipal borough of Louth has a separate
commission of the peace, and there are 14 petty sessional divisions.
The three administrative counties and the county boroughs contain
together 761 civil parishes. The ancient county contains 580
ecclesiastical parishes and districts, wholly or in part. It is mostly
in the diocese of Lincoln, but in part also in the dioceses of Southwell
and York. For parliamentary purposes the county is divided
into seven divisions, namely, West Lindsey or Gainsborough, North
Lindsey or Brigg, East Lindsey or Louth, South Lindsey or Horncastle,
North Kesteven or Sleaford, South Kesteven or Stamford,
and Holland or Spalding, and the parliamentary boroughs of Boston,
Grantham, Grimsby and Lincoln, each returning one member.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Of the details of the English conquest of the district
which is now Lincolnshire little is known, but at some time in
the 6th century Engle and Frisian invaders appear to have
settled in the country north of the Witham, where they became
known as the Lindiswaras, the southern districts from Boston
to the Trent basin being at this time dense woodland. In the
7th century the supremacy over Lindsey alternated between
Mercia and Northumbria, but few historical references to the
district are extant until the time of Alfred, whose marriage with
Ealswitha was celebrated at Gainsborough three years before
his accession. At this period the Danish inroads upon the coast
of Lindsey had already begun, and in 873 Healfdene wintered
at Torksey, while in 878 Lincoln and Stamford were included
among the five Danish boroughs, and the organization of the
districts dependent upon them probably resulted about this
time in the grouping of Lindsey, Kesteven and Holland to
form the shire of Lincoln. The extent and permanence of the
Danish influence in Lincolnshire is still observable in the names
of its towns and villages and in the local dialect, and, though
about 918 the confederate boroughs were recaptured by Edward
the Elder, in 993 a Viking fleet again entered the Humber and
ravaged Lindsey, and in 1013 the district of the five boroughs
acknowledged the supremacy of Sweyn. The county offered
no active resistance to the Conqueror, and though Hereward
appears in the Domesday Survey as a dispossessed under-tenant
of the abbot of Peterborough at Witham-on-the-Hill, the legends
surrounding his name do not belong to this county. In his northward
march in 1068 the Conqueror built a castle at Lincoln, and
portioned out the principal estates among his Norman followers,
but the Domesday Survey shows that the county on the whole
was leniently treated, and a considerable number of Englishmen
retained their lands as subtenants.</p>

<p>The origin of the three main divisions of Lincolnshire is anterior
to that of the county itself, and the outcome of purely natural
conditions, Lindsey being in Roman times practically an island
bounded by the swamps of the Trent and the Witham on the
west and south and on the east by the North Sea, while Kesteven
and Holland were respectively the regions of forest and of fen.
Lindsey in Norman times was divided into three ridings&mdash;North,
West and South&mdash;comprising respectively five, five and seven
wapentakes; while, apart from their division into wapentakes,
the Domesday Survey exhibits a unique planning out of the
ridings into approximately equal numbers of 12-carucate
hundreds, the term hundred possessing here no administrative
or local significance, but serving merely as a unit of area for
purposes of assessment. The Norman division of Holland into
the three wapentakes of Elloe, Kirton and Skirbeck has remained
unchanged to the present day. In Kesteven the wapentakes
of Aswardhurn, Aveland, Beltisloe, Haxwell, Langoe, Loveden,
Ness, Winnibriggs, and Grantham Soke have been practically
unchanged, but the Domesday wapentakes of Boothby and
Graffo now form the wapentake of Boothby Graffo. In Northriding
Bradley and Haverstoe have been combined to form
Bradley Haverstoe wapentake, and the Domesday wapentake
of Epworth in Westriding has been absorbed in that of Manley.
Wall wapentake in Westriding was a liberty of the bishop of
Lincoln, and as late as 1515 the dean and chapter of Lincoln
claimed delivery and return of writs in the manor and hundred
of Navenby. In the 13th century Baldwin Wake claimed return
of writs and a market in Aveland. William de Vesci claimed
liberties and exemptions in Caythorpe, of which he was summoned
to render account at the sheriff&rsquo;s tourn at Halton. The abbot
of Peterborough, the abbot of Tupholme, the abbot of Bardney,
the prior of Catleigh, the prior of Sixhills, the abbot of St Mary&rsquo;s,
York, the prioress of Stixwould and several lay owners claimed
liberties and jurisdiction in their Lincolnshire estates in the
13th century.</p>

<p>The shire court for Lincolnshire was held at Lincoln every
forty days, the lords of the manor attending with their stewards,
or in their absence the reeve and four men of the vill. The
ridings were each presided over by a riding-reeve, and wapentake
courts were held in the reign of Henry I. twelve times a year,
and in the reign of Henry III. every three weeks, while twice a
year all the freemen of the wapentake were summoned to the
view of frankpledge or tourn held by the sheriff. The boundaries
between Kesteven and Holland were a matter of dispute as early
as 1389 and were not finally settled until 1816.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire was originally included in the Mercian diocese of
Lichfield, but, on the subdivision of the latter by Theodore in
680, the fen-district was included in the diocese of Lichfield,
while the see for the northern parts of the county was placed
at &ldquo;Sidnacester,&rdquo; generally identified with Stow. Subsequently
both dioceses were merged in the vast West-Saxon bishopric of
Dorchester, the see of which was afterwards transferred to
Winchester, and by Bishop Remigius in 1072 to Lincoln. The
archdeaconry of Lincoln was among those instituted by Remigius,
and the division into rural deaneries also dates from this period.
Stow archdeaconry is first mentioned in 1138, and in 1291
included four deaneries, while the archdeaconry of Lincoln
included twenty-three. In 1536 the additional deaneries of Hill,
Holland, Loveden and Graffoe had been formed within the
archdeaconry of Lincoln, and the only deaneries created since
that date are East and West Elloe and North and South Grantham
in Lincoln archdeaconry. The deaneries of Gartree, Grimsby,
Hill, Horncastle, Louthesk, Ludborough, Walshcroft, Wraggoe
and Yarborough have been transferred from the archdeaconry
of Lincoln to that of Stow. Benedictine foundations existed
at Ikanho, Barrow, Bardney, Partney and Crowland as early as
the 7th century, but all were destroyed in the Danish wars, and
only Bardney and Crowland were ever rebuilt. The revival of
monasticism after the Conquest resulted in the erection of ten
Benedictine monasteries, and a Benedictine nunnery at Stainfield.
The Cistercian abbeys at Kirkstead, Louth Park, Revesby,
Vaudey and Swineshead, and the Cistercian nunnery at Stixwould
were founded in the reign of Stephen, and at the time
of the Dissolution there were upwards of a hundred religious
houses in the county.</p>

<p>In the struggles of the reign of Stephen, castles at Newark and
Sleaford were raised by Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, against
the king, while Ranulf &ldquo;Gernons,&rdquo; earl of Chester, in 1140
garrisoned Lincoln for the empress. The seizure of Lincoln by
Stephen in 1141 was accompanied with fearful butchery and
devastation, and by an accord at Stamford William of Roumare
received Kirton in Lindsey, and his tenure of Gainsborough
Castle was confirmed. In the baronial outbreak of 1173 Roger
Mowbray, who had inherited the Isle of Axholme from Nigel
d&rsquo;Albini, garrisoned Ferry East, or Kinnard&rsquo;s Ferry, and Axholme
against the king, and, after the destruction of their more northern
fortresses in this campaign, Epworth in Axholme became the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page716" id="page716"></a>716</span>
principal seat of the Mowbrays. In the struggles between John
and his barons Lincoln in 1216 made peace with the king by surrendering
hostages for the payment of a fine of 1000 marks, but
after the landing of Louis the city was captured by Gilbert de Gant,
then earl of Lincoln. After his disastrous march to Swineshead
Abbey, John journeyed through Sleaford to Newark, where he
died, and in the battle of Lincoln in 1217 Gilbert de Gant was
captured and the city sacked. At the time of the Wars of the
Roses the county, owing to territorial influence, was mainly
Lancastrian, and in 1461 the Yorkist strongholds of Grantham
and Stamford were sacked to such effect that the latter never
recovered. The Lincolnshire rising of 1470 was crushed by the
defeat of the rebels in the skirmish known as &ldquo;Losecoat Field&rdquo;
near Stamford. In the Civil War of the 17th century, Lindsey
for the most part declared for the king, and the Royalist cause
was warmly supported by the earl of Lindsey, Viscount Newark,
Sir Peregrine Bertie and the families of Dymoke, Heneage and
Thorold. Lord Willoughby of Parham was a prominent Parliamentary
leader, and the Isle of Axholme and the Puritan yeomanry
of Holland declared for the parliament. In 1643 Cromwell
won a small victory near Grantham, and the Royalist garrisons
at Lynn and Lincoln surrendered to Manchester. In 1644,
however, Newark, Gainsborough, Lincoln, Sleaford and Crowland
were all in Royalist hands, and Newark only surrendered in
1646. Among other historic families connected with Lincolnshire
were the Wakes of Bourne and the d&rsquo;Eyncourts, who
flourished at Blankney from the Conquest to the reign of
Henry VI.; Belvoir Castle was founded by the Toenis, from
whom it passed by the Daubeneys, then to the Barons Ros
and later to the Manners, earls of Rutland. In the Lindsey
Survey of 1115-1118 the name of Roger Marmion, ancestor of
the Marmion family, who had inherited the fief of Robert
Despenser, appears for the first time.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday Survey there were between 400
and 500 mills in Lincolnshire; 2111 fisheries producing large
quantities of eels; 361 salt-works; and iron forges at Stow,
St Mary and at Bytham. Lincoln and Stamford were flourishing
centres of industry, and markets existed at Kirton-in-Lindsey,
Louth, Old Bolingbroke, Spalding, Barton and Partney. The
early manufactures of the county are all connected with the
woollen trade, Lincoln being noted for its scarlet cloth in the
13th century, while an important export trade in the raw material
sprang up at Boston. The disafforesting of Kesteven in 1230
brought large areas under cultivation, and the same period is
marked by the growth of the maritime and fishing towns,
especially Boston (which had a famous fish-market), Grimsby,
Barton, Saltfleet, Wainfleet and Wrangle. The Lincolnshire
towns suffered from the general decay of trade in the eastern
counties which marked the 15th century, but agriculture was
steadily improving, and with the gradual drainage of the fen-districts
culminating in the vast operations of the 17th century,
over 330,000 acres in the county were brought under cultivation,
including more than two-thirds of Holland. The fen-drainage
resulted in the extinction of many local industries, such as the
trade in goose-feathers and the export of wild fowl to the London
markets, a 17th-century writer terming this county &ldquo;the aviary
of England, 3000 mallards with other birds having been caught
sometimes in August at one draught.&rdquo; Other historic industries
of Lincolnshire are the breeding of horses and dogs and rabbit-snaring;
the Witham was noted for its pike; and ironstone
was worked in the south, now chiefly in the north and west.</p>

<p>As early as 1295 two knights were returned to parliament for
the shire of Lincoln, and two burgesses each for Lincoln, Grimsby
and Stamford. In the 14th century Lincoln and Stamford were
several times the meeting-places of parliament or important
councils, the most notable being the Lincoln Parliament of 1301,
while at Stamford in 1309 a truce was concluded between the
barons, Piers Gaveston and the king. Stamford discontinued
representation for some 150 years after the reign of Edward II.;
Grantham was enfranchised in 1463 and Boston in 1552. Under
the act of 1832 the county was divided into a northern and
southern division, returning each two members, and Great
Grimsby lost one member. Under the act of 1868 the county
returned six members in three divisions and Stamford lost one
member. Under the act of 1885 the county returned seven
members in seven divisions; Lincoln, Boston and Grantham
lost one member each and Stamford was disfranchised.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;At the time of the suppression of the monasteries in
the reign of Henry VIII. there were upwards of one hundred religious
houses; and among the Fens rose some of the finest abbeys held
by the Benedictines. The Gilbertines were a purely English order
which took its rise in Lincolnshire, the canons following the Austin
rule, the nuns and lay brothers that of the Cistercians. They
generally lived in separate houses, but formed a community having
a common church in which the sexes were divided by a longitudinal
wall. These houses were at Alvingham, Catley, Holland Brigg,
Lincoln, before the gate of which the first Eleanor Cross was erected
by Edward I. to his wife, Newstead in Lindsey, Sempringham, the
chief house of the order, founded by St Gilbert of Gaunt in 1139,
of which the Norman nave of the church is in use, Stamford (a college
for students) and Wellow. There were nunneries of the order at
Haverholme, Nun Ormsby and Tunstal.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the most famous abbeys. Barlings
(Premonstratensian), N.E. of Lincoln, was founded 1154, for
fourteen canons. The tower, Decorated, with arcading pierced
with windows, and the east wall of the south wing remain. The
Benedictine Mitred Abbey of Crowland (<i>q.v.</i>) was founded 716, and
refounded in 948. Part of the church is still in use. Thornton
Abbey (Black Canons) in the north near the Humber was founded
in 1139. There remain a fragment of the south wing of the transept,
two sides of the decagonal chapter-house (1282) and the beautiful
west gate-house, Early Perpendicular (1332-1388), with an oriel
window on the east. Kirkstead Abbey (Cistercian) was founded
in 1139. Little remains beyond an Early English chapel of singular
beauty.</p>

<p>In the Parts of Lindsey several churches present curious early
features, particularly the well-known towers of St Peter, Barton-on-Humber,
St Mary-le-Wigford and St Peter at Gowts, Lincoln,
which exhibit work of a pre-Conquest type. Stow church for
Norman of various dates, Bottesford and St James, Grimsby, for
Early English, Tattershall and Theddlethorpe for Perpendicular are
fine examples of various styles.</p>

<p>In the Parts of Kesteven the churches are built of excellent
stone which abounds at Ancaster and near Sleaford. The church
of St Andrew, Heckington, is the best example of Decorated architecture
in the county; it is famed for its Easter sepulchre and fine
sedilia. The noble church of St Wulfram, Grantham, with one of
the finest spires in England, is also principally Decorated; this
style in fact is particularly well displayed in Kesteven, as in the
churches of Caythorpe, Claypole, Navenby and Ewerby. At
Stamford (<i>q.v.</i>) there are five churches of various styles.</p>

<p>It is principally in the Parts of Holland that the finest churches
in the county are found; they are not surpassed by those of any
other district in the kingdom, which is the more remarkable as the
district is composed wholly of marsh land and is without stone of
any kind. It is highly probable that the churches of the south part
of this district owe their origin to the munificence of the abbeys of
Crowland and Spalding. The church of Long Sutton, besides its
fine Norman nave, possesses an Early English tower and spire which
is comparable with the very early specimen at Oxford cathedral.
Whaplode church is another noteworthy example of Norman work;
for Early English work the churches of Kirtop-in-Holland, Pinchbeck
and Weston may be noticed; for Decorated those at Donington
and Spalding; and for Perpendicular, Gedney, together with parts
of Kirton church. Of the two later styles, however, by far the most
splendid example is the famous church of St Botolph, Boston
(<i>q.v.</i>), with its magnificent lantern-crowned tower or &ldquo;stump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are few remains of medieval castles, although the sites of a
considerable number are traceable. Those of Lincoln and Tattershall
(a fine Perpendicular building in brick) are the most noteworthy,
and there are also fragments at Boston and Sleaford,
Country seats worthy of note (chiefly modern) are Aswarby Hall,
Belton House, Brocklesby, Casewick, Denton Manor, Easton Hall,
Grimsthorpe (of the 16th and 18th centuries, with earlier remains),
Haverholm Priory, Nocton Hall, Panton Hall, Riby Grove, Somerby
Hall, Syston Park and Uffington. The city of Lincoln is remarkably
rich in remains of domestic architecture from the Norman period
onward, and there are similar examples at Stamford and elsewhere.
In this connexion the remarkable triangular bridge at Crowland of
the 14th century (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bridges</a></span>) should be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIND, JENNY<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1820-1887), the famous Swedish singer, was
born at Stockholm on the 6th of October 1820, the daughter
of a lace manufacturer. Mlle Lundberg, an opera-dancer, first
discovered her musical gift, and induced the child&rsquo;s mother
to have her educated for the stage; during the six or seven
years in which she was what was called an &ldquo;actress pupil,&rdquo;
she occasionally appeared on the stage, but in plays, not operas,
until 1836, when she made a first attempt in an opera by
A. F. Lindblad. She was regularly engaged at the opera-house
In 1837. Her first great success was as Agathe, in Weber&rsquo;s <i>Der
Freischütz</i>, in 1838, and by 1841, when she started for Paris,
she had already become identified with nearly all the parts in
which she afterwards became famous. But her celebrity in
Sweden was due in great part to her histrionic ability, and there
is comparatively little said about her wonderful vocal art,
which was only attained after a year&rsquo;s hard study under Manuel
Garcia, who had to remedy many faults that had caused exhaustion
in the vocal organs. On the completion of her studies she
sang before G. Meyerbeer, in private, in the Paris Opera-house,
and two years afterwards was engaged by him for Berlin, to
sing in his <i>Feldlager in Schlesien</i> (afterwards remodelled as
<i>L&rsquo; Étoile du nord</i>); but the part intended for her was taken
by another singer, and her first appearance took place in <i>Norma</i>
on the 15th of December 1844. She appeared also in Weber&rsquo;s
<i>Euryanthe</i> and Bellini&rsquo;s <i>La Sonnambula</i>, and while she was
at Berlin the English manager, Alfred Bunn, induced her to
sign a contract (which she broke) to appear in London in the
following season. In December 1845 she appeared at a
Gewandhaus concert at Leipzig, and made the acquaintance of
Mendelssohn, as well as of Joachim and many other distinguished
German musicians. In her second Berlin season she
added the parts of Donna Anna (Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Don Giovanni</i>),
Julia (Spontini&rsquo;s <i>Vestalin</i>) and Valentine (Meyerbeer&rsquo;s <i>Les
Huguenots</i>) to her repertory. She sang in operas or concerts
at Aix-la-Chapelle, Hanover, Hamburg, Vienna, Darmstadt
and Munich during the next year, and took up two Donizetti
rôles, those of Lucia and &ldquo;la Figlia del Reggimento,&rdquo; in which
she was afterwards famous. At last Lumley, the manager of
Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre, succeeded in inducing Mlle Lind to
visit England, in spite of her dread of the penalties threatened
by Bunn on her breach of the contract with him, and she appeared
on the 4th of May 1847 as Alice in Meyerbeer&rsquo;s <i>Robert le Diable</i>.
Her début had been so much discussed that the <i>furore</i> she created
was a foregone conclusion. Nevertheless it exceeded everything
of the kind that had taken place in London or anywhere else;
the sufferings and struggles of her well-dressed admirers, who
had to stand for hours to get into the pit, have become historic.
She sang in several of her favourite characters, and in that of
Susanna in Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Figaro</i>, besides creating the part of Amalia
in Verdi&rsquo;s <i>I Masnadieri</i>, written for England and performed
on the 22nd of July. In the autumn she appeared in operas
in Manchester and Liverpool, and in concerts at Brighton,
Birmingham, Hull, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Norwich,
Bristol, Bath and Exeter. At Norwich began her acquaintance
with the bishop, Edward Stanley (1779-1849), which was
said to have led to her final determination to give up the stage
as a career. After four more appearances in Berlin, and a short
visit to Stockholm, she appeared in London in the season of
1848, when she sang in Donizetti&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Elisire d&rsquo;amore</i> and
Bellini&rsquo;s <i>I Puritani</i>, in addition to her older parts. In the
same year she organized a memorable performance of <i>Elijah</i>,
with the receipts of which the Mendelssohn scholarship was
founded, and sang at a great number of charity and benefit
concerts. At the beginning of the season of 1849 she intended
to give up operatic singing, but a compromise was effected by
which she was to sing the music of six operas, performed without
action, at Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre; but the first, a concert performance
of Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Il Flauto magico</i>, was so coldly received
that she felt bound, for the sake of the manager and the public,
to give five more regular representations, and her last performance
on the stage was on the 10th of May 1849, in <i>Robert le Diable</i>.
Her decision was not even revoked when the king of Sweden
urged her to reappear in opera at her old home. She paid
visits to Germany and Sweden again before her departure
for America in 1850. Just before sailing she appeared at
Liverpool, for the first time in England, in an oratorio of Handel,
singing the soprano music in <i>The Messiah</i> with superb art.
She remained in America for nearly two years, being for a
great part of the time engaged by P. T. Barnum. In Boston,
on the 5th of February 1852, she married Otto Goldschmidt
(1829-1907), whom she had met at Lübeck in 1850. For some
years after her return to England, her home for the rest of her
life, she appeared in oratorios and concerts, and her dramatic
instincts were as strongly and perhaps as advantageously displayed
in these surroundings as they had been on the stage,
for the grandeur of her conceptions in such passages as the
&ldquo;Sanctus&rdquo; of <i>Elijah</i>, the intensity of conviction which she
threw into the scene of the widow in the same work, or the
religious fervour of &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth,&rdquo; could
not have found a place in opera. In her later years she took
an active interest in the Bach Choir, conducted by her husband,
and not only sang herself in the chorus, but gave the benefit
of her training to the ladies of the society. For some years
she was professor of singing at the Royal College of Music.
Her last public appearance was at Düsseldorf on the 20th of
January 1870 when she sang in <i>Ruth</i>, an oratorio composed by
her husband. She died at Malvern on the 2nd of November 1887.
The supreme position she held so long in the operatic world was
due not only to the glory of her voice, and the complete musicianship
which distinguished her above all her contemporaries, but
also to the naïve simplicity of her acting in her favourite parts,
such as Amina, Alice or Agathe. In these and others she
had the precious quality of conviction, and identified herself
with the characters she represented with a thoroughness rare in
her day. Unharmed by the perils of a stage career, she was a
model of rectitude, generosity and straightforwardness, carrying
the last quality into a certain blunt directness of manner that
was sometimes rather startling.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDAU, PAUL<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1839-&emsp;&emsp;), German dramatist and novelist,
the son of a Protestant pastor, was born at Magdeburg on the
3rd of June 1839. He was educated at the gymnasium in
Halle and subsequently in Leipzig and Berlin. He spent five
years in Paris to further his studies, acting meanwhile as foreign
correspondent to German papers. After his return to Germany in
1863 he was engaged in journalism in Düsseldorf and Elberfeld.
In 1870 he founded <i>Das neue Blatt</i> at Leipzig; from 1872 to
1881 he edited the Berlin weekly, <i>Die Gegenwart</i>; and in 1878
he founded the well-known monthly, <i>Nord und Süd</i>, which
he continued to edit until 1904. Two books of travel, <i>Aus
Venetien</i> (Düsseldorf, 1864) and <i>Aus Paris</i> (Stuttgart, 1865).
were followed by some volumes of critical studies, written in
a light, satirical vein, which at once made him famous. These
were <i>Harmlose Briefe eines deutschen Kleinstädters</i> (Leipzig,
2 vols., 1870), <i>Moderne Märchen für grosse Kinder</i> (Leipzig,
1870) and <i>Literarische Rücksichtslosigkeiten</i> (Leipzig, 1871).
He was appointed intendant of the court theatre at Meiningen
in 1895, but removed to Berlin in 1899, where he became
manager of the Berliner Theater, and subsequently, until 1905,
of the Deutsches Theater. He had begun his dramatic career
in 1868 with <i>Marion</i>, the first of a long series of plays in
which he displayed a remarkable talent for stage effect and
a command of witty and lively dialogue. Among the more
famous were <i>Maria und Magdalena</i> (1872), <i>Tante Therese</i>
(1876), <i>Gräfin Lea</i> (1879), <i>Die Erste</i> (1895), <i>Der Abend</i> (1896),
<i>Der Herr im Hause</i> (1899), <i>So ich dir</i> (1903), and he adapted
many plays by Dumas, Augier and Sardou for the German
stage. Five volumes of his plays have been published (Berlin,
1873-1888). Some of his volumes of short stories acquired
great popularity, notably <i>Herr und Frau Bewer</i> (Breslau, 1882)
and T<i>oggenburg und andere Geschichten</i> (Breslau, 1883). A
novel-sequence entitled <i>Berlin</i> included <i>Der Zug nach dem
Westen</i> (Stuttgart, 1886, 10th ed. 1903), <i>Arme Mädchen</i> (1887,
9th ed. 1905) and <i>Spitzen</i> (1888, 8th ed. 1904). Later novels
were <i>Die Gehilfin</i> (Breslau, 1894), <i>Die Brüder</i>, (Dresden, 1895),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page718" id="page718"></a>718</span>
<i>Der König von Sidon</i> (Breslau, 1898). His earlier books on
<i>Molière</i> (Leipzig, 1871) and <i>Alfred de Musset</i> (Berlin, 1877)
were followed by some volumes of dramatic and literary criticism,
<i>Gesammelte Aufsätze</i> (Berlin, 1875), <i>Dramaturgische Blätter</i>
(Stuttgart, 2 vols., 1875; new series, Breslau, 1878, 2 vols.),
<i>Vorspiele auf dem Theater</i> (Breslau, 1895).</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Rudolf Lindau</span> (b. 1829), was a well-known
diplomatist and author. His novels and tales were collected
in 1893 (Berlin, 6 vols.). The most attractive, such as <i>Reisegefährten</i>
and <i>Der lange Holländer</i>, deal with the life of European
residents in the Far East.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDAU,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> a town and pleasure resort in the kingdom of
Bavaria, and the central point of the transit trade between
that country and Switzerland, situated on two islands off the
north-eastern shore of Lake Constance. Pop. (1905) 6531.
The town is a terminus of the Vorarlberg railway, and of the
Munich-Lindau line of the Bavarian state railways, and is
connected with the mainland both by a wooden bridge and by
a railway enbankment erected in 1853. There are a royal
palace and an old and a new town-hall (the older one having
been built in 1422 and restored in 1886-1888), a museum and
a municipal library with interesting manuscripts and a collection
of Bibles, also classical, commercial and industrial schools.
The harbour is much frequented by steamers from Constance
and other places on the lake. There are also some Roman
remains, the Heidenmauer, and a fine modern fountain, the
Reichsbrunnen. Opposite the custom-house is a bronze statue
of the Bavarian king Maximilian II., erected in 1856.</p>

<p>On the site now occupied by the town there was a Roman
camp, the <i>castrum Tiberii</i>, and the authentic records of Lindau
date back to the end of the 9th century, when it was known
as Lintowa. In 1274, or earlier, it became a free imperial

<p><span class="bold">LINDESAY, ROBERT,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> of Pitscottie (<i>c.</i> 1530-<i>c.</i> 1590), Scottish
historian, of the family of the Lindesays of the Byres, was born
at Pitscottie, in the parish of Ceres, Fifeshire, which he held
in lease at a later period. His <i>Historie and Cronicles of Scotland</i>,
the only work by which he is remembered, is described as a
continuation of that of Hector Boece, translated by John
Bellenden. It covers the period from 1437 to 1565, and,
though it sometimes degenerates into a mere chronicle of short
entries, is not without passages of great picturesqueness. Sir
Walter Scott made use of it in <i>Marmion</i>; and, in spite of its
inaccuracy in details, it is useful for the social history of the
period. Lindesay&rsquo;s share in the <i>Cronicles</i> was generally supposed
to end with 1565; but Dr Aeneas Mackay considers that the
frank account of the events connected with Mary Stuart
between 1565 and 1575 contained in one of the MSS. is by
his hand and was only suppressed because it was too faithful
in its record of contemporary affairs.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Historie and Cronicles</i> was first published in 1728. A complete
edition of the text (2 vols.), based on the Laing MS. No. 218 in the
university of Edinburgh, was published by the Scottish Text Society
in 1899 under the editorship of Aeneas J. G. Mackay. The
MS., formerly in the possession of John Scott of Halkshill, is fuller,
and, though in a later hand, is, on the whole, a better representative
of Lindesay&rsquo;s text.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDET, JEAN BAPTISTE ROBERT<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1749-1825), French
revolutionist, was born at Bernay (Eure). Before the Revolution
he was an <i>avocat</i> at Bernay. He acted as <i>procureur-syndic</i> of
the district of Bernay during the session of the Constituent
Assembly. Appointed deputy to the Legislative Assembly
and subsequently to the Convention, he attained considerable
prominence. He was very hostile to the king, furnished a
<i>Rapport sur les crimes imputés à Louis Capet</i> (10th of December
1792), and voted for the death of Louis without appeal or
respite. He was instrumental in the establishment of the
Revolutionary Tribunal and contributed to the downfall of
the Girondists. As member of the Committee of Public Safety,
he devoted himself particularly to the question of food-supplies,
and it was only by dint of dogged perseverance and great administrative
talent that he was successful in coping with this
difficult problem. He had meanwhile been sent to suppress
revolts in the districts of Rhône, Eure, Calvados and Finistère,
where he had been able to pursue a conciliatory policy. Without
being formally opposed to Robespierre, he did not support him,
and he was the only member of the Committee of Public Safety
who did not sign the order for the execution of Danton and
his party. In a like spirit of moderation he opposed the
Thermidorian reaction, and defended Barère, Billaud-Varenne
the Collot d&rsquo;Herbois from the accusations launched against them
on the 22nd of March 1795. Himself denounced on the 20th
of May 1795, he was defended by his brother Thomas, but only
escaped condemnation by the vote of amnesty of the 4th of
Brumaire, year IV. (26th of October 1795). He was minister
of finance from the 18th of June to the 9th of November 1799,
but refused office under the Consulate and the Empire. In
1816 he was proscribed by the Restoration government as a
regicide, and did not return to France until just before his
death on the 17th of February 1825. His brother Thomas
made some mark as a Constitutional bishop and member of
the Convention.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDLEY, JOHN<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1799-1865), English botanist, was born
on the 5th of February 1799 at Catton, near Norwich, where
his father, George Lindley, author of <i>A Guide to the Orchard
and Kitchen Garden</i>, owned a nursery garden. He was educated
at Norwich grammar school. His first publication, in 1819,
a translation of the <i>Analyse du fruit</i> of L. C. M. Richard, was
followed in 1820 by an original <i>Monographia Rosarum</i>, with
descriptions of new species, and drawings executed by himself,
and in 1821 by <i>Monographia Digitalium</i>, and by &ldquo;Observations
on Pomaceae,&rdquo; contributed to the Linnean Society. Shortly
afterwards he went to London, where he was engaged by J. C.
Loudon to write the descriptive portion of the <i>Encyclopaedia of
Plants</i>. In his labours on this undertaking, which was completed
in 1829, he became convinced of the superiority of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
system of A. L. de Jussieu, as distinguished from the &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;
system of Linnaeus followed in the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>; the conviction
found expression in <i>A Synopsis of British Flora, arranged
according to the Natural Order</i> (1829) and in <i>An Introduction
to the Natural System of Botany</i> (1830). In 1829 Lindley, who
since 1822 had been assistant secretary to the Horticultural
Society, was appointed to the chair of botany in University
College, London, which he retained till 1860; he lectured also
on botany from 1831 at the Royal Institution, and from 1836
at the Botanic Gardens, Chelsea. During his professoriate
he wrote many scientific and popular works, besides contributing
largely to the <i>Botanical Register</i>, of which he was editor
for many years, and to the <i>Gardener&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>, in which he
had charge of the horticultural department from 1841. He was
a fellow of the Royal, Linnean and Geological Societies. He died
at Turnham Green on the 1st of November 1865.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDLEY, NATHANIEL LINDLEY<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1828-&emsp;&emsp;),
English judge, son of John Lindley (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Acton
Green, Middlesex, on the 29th of November 1828. He was
educated at University College School, and studied for a time
at University College, London. He was called to the bar at the
Middle Temple in 1850, and began practice in the Court of
Chancery. In 1855 he published <i>An Introduction to the Study of
Jurisprudence</i>, consisting of a translation of the general part of
Thibaut&rsquo;s <i>System des Pandekten Rechts</i>, with copious notes. In
1860 he published in two volumes his <i>Treatise on the Law of
Partnership, including its Application to Joint Stock and other
Companies</i>, and in 1862 a supplement including the Companies
Act of 1862. This work has since been developed into two text-books
well known to lawyers as <i>Lindley on Companies</i> and
<i>Lindley on Partnership</i>. He became a Q.C. in January 1872.
In 1874 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple, of which
he was treasurer in 1894. In 1875 he was appointed a justice of
common pleas, the appointment of a chancery barrister to a
common-law court being justified by the fusion of law and equity
then shortly to be brought about, in theory at all events, by
the Judicature Acts. In pursuance of the changes now made
be became a justice of the common pleas division of the High
Court of Justice, and in 1880 of the queen&rsquo;s bench division. In
1881 he was raised to the Court of Appeal and made a privy
councillor. In 1897, Lord Justice Lindley succeeded Lord
Esher as master of the rolls, and in 1900 he was made a lord of
appeal in ordinary with a life peerage and the title of Baron
Lindley. He resigned the judicial post in 1905. Lord Lindley
was the last serjeant-at-law appointed, and the last judge to
wear the serjeant&rsquo;s coif, or rather the black patch representing
it, on the judicial wig. He married in 1858 Sarah Katherine,
daughter of Edward John Teale of Leeds.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDLEY, WILLIAM<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1808-1900), English engineer, was born
in London on the 7th of September 1808, and became a pupil
under Francis Giles, whom he assisted in designing the Newcastle
and Carlisle and the London and Southampton railways. Leaving
England about 1837, he was engaged for a time in railway work
in various parts of Europe, and then returned, as engineer-in-chief
to the Hamburg-Bergedorf railway, to Hamburg, near
which city he had received his early education, and to which he
was destined to stand in much the same relation as Baron Haussmann
to Paris. His first achievement was to drain the Hammerbrook
marshes, and so add some 1400 acres to the available area
of the city. His real opportunity, however, came with the great
fire which broke out on the 5th of May 1842 and burned for three
days. He was entrusted with the direction of the operations to
check its spread, and the strong measures he adopted, including
the blowing-up of the town hall, brought bis life into danger
with the mob, who professed to see in him an English agent
charged with the destruction of the port of Hamburg. After the
extinction of the fire he was appointed consulting engineer to
the senate and town council, to the Water Board and to the
Board of Works. He began with the construction of a complete
sewerage system on principles which did not escape criticism,
but which experience showed to be good. Between 1844 and
1848 water-works were established from his designs, the intake
from the Elbe being at Rothenburgsort. Subsidence tanks were
used for clarification, but in 1853, when he designed large extensions,
he urged the substitution of sand-filtration, which,
however, was not adopted until the cholera epidemic of 1892-1893
had shown the folly of the opposition directed against it.
In 1846 he erected the Hamburg gas-works; public baths and
wash-houses were built, and large extensions to the port executed
according to his plans in 1854; and he supervised the construction
of the Altona gas and water works in 1855. Among other
services he rendered to the city may be mentioned the trigonometrical
survey executed between 1848 and 1860, and the
conduct of the negotiations which in 1852 resulted in the sale of
the &ldquo;Steelyard&rdquo; on the banks of the Thames belonging to it
jointly with the two other Hanseatic towns, Bremen and Lübeck.
In 1860 he left Hamburg, and during the remaining nineteen
years of his professional practice he was responsible for many
engineering works in various European cities, among them being
Frankfort-on-the-Main, Warsaw, Pesth, Düsseldorf, Galatz and
Basel. In Frankfort he constructed sewerage works on the
same principles as those he followed in Hamburg, and the system
was widely imitated not only in Europe, but also in America.
He was also consulted in regard to water-works at Berlin, Kiel,
Stralsund, Stettin and Leipzig; he advised the New River
Company of London on the adoption of the constant supply
system in 1851; and he was commissioned by the British
Government to carry out various works in Heligoland, including
the big retaining wall &ldquo;Am Falm.&rdquo; He died at Blackheath,
London, on the 22nd of May 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINDO, MARK PRAGER<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1819-1879), Dutch prose writer,
of English-Jewish descent, was born in London on the 18th of
September 1810. He went to Holland when nineteen years of
age, and once established there as a private teacher of the
English language, he soon made up his mind to remain. In
1842 he passed his examination at Arnhem, qualifying him
as a professor of English in Holland, subsequently becoming a
teacher of the English language and literature at the gymnasium
in that town. In 1853 he was appointed in a similar capacity
at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Meanwhile Lindo
had obtained a thorough grasp of the Dutch language, partly
during his student years at Utrecht University, where in 1854 he
gained the degree of doctor of literature. His proficiency in the
two languages led him to translate into Dutch several of the
works of Dickens, Thackeray and others, and afterwards also of
Fielding, Sterne and Walter Scott. Some of Lindo&rsquo;s translations
bore the imprint of hasty and careless work, and all were very
unequal in quality. His name is much more likely to endure
as the writer of humorous original sketches and novelettes in
Dutch, which he published under the pseudonym of De Oude
Herr Smits (&ldquo;Old Mr Smits&rdquo;). Among the most popular are;
<i>Brieven en Ontboezemingen</i> (&ldquo;Letters and Confessions,&rdquo; 1853,
with three &ldquo;Continuations&rdquo;); <i>Familie van Ons</i> (&ldquo;Family of
Ours,&rdquo; 1855); <i>Bekentenissen eener Jonge Dame</i> (&ldquo;Confessions of
a Young Lady,&rdquo; 1858); <i>Uittreksels uit het Dagboek van Wijlen
den Heer Janus Snor</i> (&ldquo;Extracts from the Diary of the late Mr
Janus Snor,&rdquo; 1865); <i>Typen</i> (&ldquo;Types,&rdquo; 1871); and, particularly,
<i>Afdrukken van Indrukken</i> (&ldquo;Impressions from Impressions,&rdquo;
1854, reprinted many times). The last-named was written in
collaboration with Lodewyk Mulder, who contributed some of its
drollest whimsicalities of Dutch life and character, which, for
that reason, are almost untranslatable. Lodewyk Mulder and
Lindo also founded together, and carried on, for a considerable
time alone, the <i>Nederlandsche Spectator</i> (&ldquo;The Dutch Spectator&rdquo;),
a literary weekly, still published at The Hague, which bears little
resemblance to its English prototype, and which perhaps reached
its greatest popularity and influence when Vosmaer contributed
to it a brilliant weekly letter under the fanciful title of Vlugmaren
(&ldquo;Swifts&rdquo;). Lindo&rsquo;s serious original Dutch writings he published
under his own name, the principal one being <i>De Opkomst
en Ontwikkeling van het Engelsche Volk</i> (&ldquo;The Rise and Development
of the British People,&rdquo; 2 vols. 1868-1874)&mdash;a valuable
history. Lodewyk Mulder published in 1877-1879 a collected
edition of Lindo&rsquo;s writings in five volumes, and there has since
been a popular reissue. Lindo was appointed an inspector of
primary schools in the province of South Holland in 1865, a post
he held until his death at The Hague on the 9th of March 1879.</p>

was born in Middlewich, Cheshire, on the 20th of June 1723,
and was educated at the Leeds Free School and at St John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, where in 1747 he became a fellow. For
some time he held a curacy in Spitalfields, London, and from
1734 to 1756 he travelled on the continent of Europe as tutor
to the young duke of Northumberland. He was then presented
to the living of Kirkby-Wiske in Yorkshire, and after exchanging
it for that of Piddletown in Dorsetshire, he removed in 1763 to
Catterick in Yorkshire. Here about 1764 he founded one of the
first Sunday schools in England. Meanwhile he had begun to
entertain anti-Trinitarian views, and to be troubled in conscience
about their inconsistency with the Anglican belief; since 1769
the intimate friendship of Joseph Priestley had served to foster
his scruples, and in 1771 he united with Francis Blackburne,
archdeacon of Cleveland (his father-in-law), John Jebb (1736-1786),
Christopher Wyvill (1740-1822) and Edmund Law (1703-1787),
bishop of Carlisle, in preparing a petition to parliament
with the prayer that clergymen of the church and graduates of
the universities might be relieved from the burden of subscribing
to the thirty-nine articles, and &ldquo;restored to their undoubted
rights as Protestants of interpreting Scripture for themselves.&rdquo;
Two hundred and fifty signatures were obtained, but in February
1772 the House of Commons declined even to receive the petition
by a majority of 217 to 71; the adverse vote was repeated in the
following year, and in the end of 1773, seeing no prospect of
obtaining within the church the relief which his conscience
demanded, Lindsey resigned his vicarage. In April 1774 he
began to conduct Unitarian services in a room in Essex Street,
Strand, London, where first a church, and afterwards the Unitarian
offices, were established. Here he remained till 1793,
when he resigned his charge in favour of John Disney (1746-1816),
who like himself had left the established church and had
become his colleague. He died on the 3rd of November 1808.</p>

school teacher, and in 1858 a master in the grammar school at
Wisby. His leisure was devoted to researches on the fossils of
the Silurian rocks of Gotland, including the corals, brachiopods,
gasteropods, pteropods, cephalopods and crustacea. He described
also remains of the fish <i>Cyathaspis</i> from Wenlock Beds, and

tow (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Linen</a></span>). The ultimate origin is also seen in the verb
&ldquo;to line,&rdquo; to cover something on the inside, originally used of the
&ldquo;lining&rdquo; of a garment with linen.</p>

<p>In mathematics several definitions of the line may be framed
according to the aspect from which it is viewed. The synthetical
genesis of a line from the notion of a point is the basis of Euclid&rsquo;s
definition, <span class="grk" title="grammê, de mêkos aplates">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8052;, &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8134;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;a line is widthless
length&rdquo;), and in a subsequent definition he affirms that the
boundaries of a line are points, <span class="grk" title="grammês de perata sêmeia">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8134;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>.
The line appears in definition 6 as the boundary of a surface:
<span class="grk" title="epiphaneias de perata grammai">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#7984;</span> (&ldquo;the boundaries of a surface
are lines&rdquo;). Another synthetical definition, also treated by
the ancient Greeks, but not by Euclid, regards the line as
generated by the motion of a point (<span class="grk" title="rhysis sêmeiou">&#8165;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span>), and, in a
similar manner, the &ldquo;surface&rdquo; was regarded as the flux of a
line, and a &ldquo;solid&rdquo; as the flux of a surface. Proclus adopts this
view, styling the line <span class="grk" title="archê">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;</span> in respect of this capacity. Analytical
definitions, although not finding a place in the Euclidean treatment,
have advantages over the synthetical derivation. Thus
the boundaries of a solid may define a plane, the edges a line,
and the corners a point; or a section of a solid may define the
surface, a section of a surface the line, and the section of a line
the &ldquo;point.&rdquo; The notion of dimensions follows readily from
either system of definitions. The solid extends three ways,
<i>i.e.</i> it has length, breadth and thickness, and is therefore three-dimensional;
the surface has breadth and length and is therefore
two-dimensional; the line has only extension and is unidimensional;
and the point, having neither length, breadth nor thickness
but only position, has no dimensions.</p>

<p>The definition of a &ldquo;straight&rdquo; line is a matter of much complexity.
Euclid defines it as the line which lies evenly with
respect to the points on itself&mdash;<span class="grk" title="eutheia grammê estin hêtis ex
isou tois eph heautês sêmeiois keitai">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#942; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7973;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#958;

line having its middle point hidden by the ends, a definition of
no purpose since it only defines the line by the path of a ray of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page721" id="page721"></a>721</span>
light. Archimedes defines a straight line as the shortest distance
between two points.</p>

<p>A better criterion of rectilinearity is that of Simplicius, an
Arabian commentator of the 5th century: <i>Linea recta est
quaecumque super duas ipsius extremitates rotata non movetur
de loco suo ad alium locum</i> (&ldquo;a straight line is one which when
rotated about its two extremities does not change its position&rdquo;).
This idea was employed by Leibnitz, and most auspiciously
by Gierolamo Saccheri in 1733.</p>

<p>The drawing of a straight line between any two given points
forms the subject of Euclid&rsquo;s first postulate&mdash;<span class="grk" title="êitêsthô apo
pantos sêmeiou epi pan sêmeion eutheian grammên agagein">&#8080;&#953;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#952;&#969; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#8016;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#957; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,
and the producing of a straight line continuously in a straight

<div class="condensed">
<p>For a detailed analysis of the geometrical notion of the line and
rectilinearity, see W. B. Frankland, <i>Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</i> (1905). In
analytical geometry the right line is always representable by an
equation or equations of the first degree; thus in Cartesian coordinates
of two dimensions the equation is of the form
Ax + By + C = 0, in triangular coordinates Ax + By + Cz = 0. In
three-dimensional coordinates, the line is represented by two linear
equations. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry, Analytical</a></span>.) <i>Line geometry</i> is a
branch of analytical geometry in which the line is the element, and
not the point as with ordinary analytical geometry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry,
Line</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINE ENGRAVING,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> on plates of copper or steel, the method
of engraving (<i>q.v.</i>), in which the line itself is hollowed, whereas
in the woodcut when the line is to print black it is left in relief,
and only white spaces and white lines are hollowed.</p>

<p>The art of line engraving has been practised from the earliest
ages. The prehistoric Aztec hatchet given to Humboldt in
Mexico was just as truly <i>engraved</i> as a modern copper-plate
which may convey a design by Flaxman; the Aztec engraving
is ruder than the European, but it is the same art. The
important discovery which made line engraving one of the
multiplying arts was the discovery how to print an incised line,
which was hit upon at last by accident, and known for some time
before its real utility was suspected. Line engraving in Europe
does not owe its origin to the woodcut, but to the chasing on
goldsmiths&rsquo; work. The goldsmiths of Florence in the middle of
the 15th century were in the habit of ornamenting their works
by means of engraving, after which they filled up the hollows
produced by the burin with a black enamel made of silver, lead
and sulphur, the result being that the design was rendered much
more visible by the opposition of the enamel and the metal.
An engraved design filled up in this manner was called a <i>niello</i>.
Whilst a niello was in progress the artist could not see it so well
as if the enamel were already in the lines, yet he did not like to
put in the hard enamel prematurely, as when once it was set
it could not easily be got out again. He therefore took a sulphur
cast of his niello in progress, on a matrix of fine clay, and filled
up the lines in the sulphur with lampblack, thus enabling himself
to judge of the state of his engraving. At a later period
it was discovered that a proof could be taken on damped paper
by filling the engraved lines with a certain ink and wiping it
off the surface of the plate, sufficient pressure being applied
to make the paper go into the hollowed lines and fetch the ink
out of them. This was the beginning of plate printing. The
niello engravers thought it a convenient way of proving their
work&mdash;the metal itself&mdash;as it saved the trouble of the sulphur
cast, but they saw no further into the future. They went on
engraving nielli just the same to ornament plate and furniture;
nor was it until the 16th century that the new method of printing
was carried out to its great and wonderful results. There are,
however, certain differences between plate-printing and block-printing
which affect the essentials of art. When paper is driven
<i>into</i> a line so as to fetch the ink out of it, the line may be of unimaginable
fineness, it will print all the same; but when the
paper is only pressed <i>upon</i> a raised line, the line must have some
appreciable thickness; the wood engraving, therefore, can
never&mdash;except in a <i>tour de force</i>&mdash;be so delicate as plate engraving.
Again, not only does plate-printing excel block-printing in
delicacy; it excels it also in force and depth. There never was,
and there will never be, a woodcut line having the power of a
deep line in a plate, for in block-printing the line is only a blackened
surface of paper slightly impressed, whereas in plate-printing it
is a <i>cast</i> with an additional thickness of printing ink.</p>

<p>The most important of the tools used in line-engraving is
the burin, which is a bar of steel with one end fixed in a handle
rather like a mushroom with one side cut away, the burin itself
being shaped so that the cutting end when sharpened takes the
form of a lozenge, point downwards. The burin acts exactly
like a plough; it makes a furrow and turns out a shaving of
metal as the plough turns the soil of a field. The burin, however,
is pushed while the plough is pulled, and this peculiar character
of the burin, or graver, as a pushed instrument at once establishes
a wide separation between it and all the other instruments
employed in the arts of design, such as pencils, brushes, pens
and etching needles.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The elements of engraving with the burin upon metal will be
best understood by an example of a very simple kind, as in the
engraving of letters. The capital letter B contains in itself the
rudiments of an engraver&rsquo;s education. As at first drawn, before the
blacks are inserted, this letter consists of two perpendicular straight
lines and four curves, all the curves differing from each other.
Suppose, then, that the engraver has to make a B, he will scratch
these lines, reversed, very lightly with a sharp point or style. The
next thing is to cut out the blacks (not the whites, as in wood
engraving), and this would be done with two different burins. The
engraver would get his vertical black line by a powerful ploughing
with the burin between his two preparatory first lines, and then
take out some copper in the thickest parts of the two curves. This
done, he would then take a finer burin and work out the gradation
from the thick line in the midst of the curve to the thin extremities
which touch the perpendicular. When there is much gradation in
a line the darker parts of it are often gradually ploughed out by
returning to it over and over again. The hollows so produced are
afterwards filled with printing ink, just as the hollows in a niello
were filled with black enamel; the surplus printing ink is wiped
from the smooth surface of the copper, damped paper is laid upon it,
and driven into the hollowed letter by the pressure of a revolving
cylinder; it fetches the ink out, and you have your letter B in
intense black upon a white ground.</p>

<p>When the surface of a metal plate is sufficiently polished to be
used for engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black
line, the degree of blackness being proportioned to the depth of the
scratch. An engraved plate from which visiting cards are printed
is a good example of some elementary principles of engraving. It
contains thin lines and thick ones, and a considerable variety of
curves. An elaborate line engraving, if it is a pure line engraving
and nothing else, will contain only these simple elements in different
combinations. The real line engraver is always engraving a line
more or less broad and deep in one direction or another; he has no
other business than this.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early Italian and early German prints, the line is used
with such perfect simplicity of purpose that the methods of the
artists are as obvious as if we saw them actually at work.</p>

<p>The student may soon understand the spirit and technical
quality of the earliest Italian engraving by giving his attention
to a few of the series which used erroneously to be called the
&ldquo;Playing Cards of Mantegna,&rdquo; but which have been shown
by Mr Sidney Colvin to represent &ldquo;a kind of encyclopaedia of
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history of these engravings is obscure. They are supposed
to be Florentine; they are certainly Italian; and their technical
manner is called that of Baccio Baldini. But their style is as
clear as a style can be, as clear as the artist&rsquo;s conception of his
art. In all these figures the outline is the main thing, and next
to that the lines which mark the leading folds of the drapery;
lines quite classical in purity of form and severity of selection,
and especially characteristic in this, that they are always really
engraver&rsquo;s lines, such as may naturally be done with the burin,
and they never imitate the freer line of the pencil or etching
needle. Shading is used in the greatest moderation with thin
straight strokes of the burin, that never overpower the stronger
organic lines of the design. Of chiaroscuro, in any complete
sense, there is none. The sky behind the figures is represented
by white paper, and the foreground is sometimes occupied by
flat decorative engraving, much nearer in feeling to calligraphy
than to modern painting. Sometimes there is a cast shadow,
but it is not studied, and is only used to give relief. In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page722" id="page722"></a>722</span>
early metal engraving the lines are often crossed in the shading,
whereas in the earliest woodcuts they are not; the reason being
that when lines are incised they can as easily be crossed as not,
whereas, when they are reserved, the crossing involves much
labour of a non-artistic kind. Here, then, we have pure line-engraving
with the burin, that is, the engraving of the pure
line patiently studied for its own beauty, and exhibited in an
abstract manner, with care for natural form combined with
inattention to the effects of nature. Even the forms are idealized,
especially in the cast of draperies, for the express purpose of
exhibiting the line to better advantage. Such are the characteristics
of those very early Italian engravings which were attributed
erroneously to Mantegna. When we come to Mantegna himself
we find a style equally decided. Drawing and shading were for
him two entirely distinct things. He did not draw and shade
at the same time, as a modern chiaroscurist would, but he first
got his outlines and the patterns on his dresses all very accurate,
and then threw over them a veil of shading, a very peculiar
kind of shading, all the lines being straight and all the shading
diagonal. This is the primitive method, its peculiarities being
due, not to a learned self-restraint, but to a combination of natural
genius with technical inexperience, which made the early Italians
at once desire and discover the simplest and easiest methods.
Whilst the Italians were shading with straight lines the Germans
had begun to use curves, and as soon as the Italians saw good
German work they tried to give to their burins something of
the German suppleness.</p>

<p>The characteristics of early metal engraving in Germany are
seen to perfection in Martin Schongauer and Albert Dürer,
who, though with striking differences, had many points in common.
Schongauer died in 1488; whilst the date of Dürer&rsquo;s death is
1528. Schongauer was therefore a whole generation before
Dürer, yet not greatly inferior to him in the use of the burin,
though Dürer has a much greater reputation, due in great measure
to his singular imaginative powers. Schongauer is the first
great German engraver known by name, but he was preceded
by an unknown German master, called &ldquo;the Master of 1466,&rdquo;
who had Gothic notions of art (in strong contrast to the classicism
of Baccio Baldini), but used the burin skilfully, conceiving of
line and shade as separate elements, yet shading with an
evident desire to follow the form of the thing shaded, and with
lines in various directions. Schongauer&rsquo;s art is a great stride
in advance, and we find in him an evident pleasure in the bold
use of the burin. Outline and shade, in Schongauer, are not
nearly so much separated as in Baccio Baldini, and the shading,
generally in curved lines, is far more masterly than the straight
shading of Mantegna. Dürer continued Schongauer&rsquo;s curved
shading, with increasing manual delicacy and skill; and as he
found himself able to perform feats with the burin which amused
both himself and his buyers, he over-loaded his plates with
quantities of living and inanimate objects, each of which he
finished with as much care as if it were the most important
thing in the composition. The engravers of those days had no
conception of any necessity for subordinating one part of their
work to another; they drew, like children, first one object
and then another object, and so on until the plate was furnished
from top to bottom and from the left side to the right. Here,
of course, is an element of facility in primitive art which is denied
to the modern artist. In Dürer all objects are on the same plane.
In his &ldquo;St Hubert&rdquo; (otherwise known as &ldquo;St Eustace&rdquo;) of
c. 1505, the stag is quietly standing on the horse&rsquo;s back, with
one hoof on the saddle, and the kneeling knight looks as if he
were tapping the horse on the nose. Dürer seems to have perceived
the mistake about the stag, for he put a tree between us
and the animal to correct it, but the stag is on the horse&rsquo;s back
nevertheless. This ignorance of the laws of effect is least visible
and obtrusive in plates which have no landscape distances,
such as &ldquo;The Coat of Arms with the Death&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; (1503)
and &ldquo;The Coat of Arms with the Cock&rdquo; (<i>c.</i> 1512).</p>

<p>Dürer&rsquo;s great manual skill and close observation made him
a wonderful engraver of objects taken separately. He saw and
rendered all objects; nothing escaped him; he applied the same
intensity of study to everything. Though a thorough student of
the nude&mdash;witness his Adam and Eve (1504) and other plates&mdash;he
would pay just as much attention to the creases of a gaiter
as to the development of a muscle; and though man was his
main subject, he would study dogs with equal care (see the five
dogs in the &ldquo;St Hubert&rdquo;), as well as pigs (see the &ldquo;Prodigal Son,&rdquo;
<i>c.</i> 1495); and at a time when landscape painting was unknown
he studied every clump of trees, every visible trunk and branch,
nay, every foreground plant, and each leaf of it separately.
In his buildings he saw every brick like a bricklayer, and every
joint in the woodwork like a carpenter. The immense variety
of the objects which he engraved was a training in suppleness
of hand. His lines go in every direction, and are made to render
both the undulations of surfaces (see the plane in the Melencolia,
1514) and their texture (see the granular texture of the stones
in the same print).</p>

<p>From Dürer we come to Italy again, through Marcantonio,
who copied Dürer, translating more than sixty of his woodcuts
upon metal. It is one of the most remarkable things in the history
of art, that a man who had trained himself by copying northern
work, little removed from pure Gothicism, should have become
soon afterwards the great engraver of Raphael, who was much
pleased with his work and aided him by personal advice. Yet,
although Raphael was a painter, and Marcantonio his interpreter,
the reader is not to infer that engraving had as yet subordinated
itself to painting. Raphael himself evidently considered engraving
a distinct art, for he never once set Marcantonio to work
from a picture, but always (much more judiciously) gave him
drawings, which the engraver might interpret without going
outside his own art; consequently Marcantonio&rsquo;s works are
always genuine engravings, and are never pictorial. Marcantonio
was an engraver of remarkable power. In him the real
pure art of line-engraving reached its maturity. He retained
much of the early Italian manner in his backgrounds, where its
simplicity gives a desirable sobriety; but his figures are boldly
modelled in curved lines, crossing each other in the darker
shades, but left single in the passages from dark to light, and
breaking away in fine dots as they approach the light itself, which
is of pure white paper. A school of engraving was thus founded
by Raphael, through Marcantonio, which cast aside the minute
details of the early schools for a broad, harmonious treatment.</p>

<p>The group known as the engravers of Rubens marked a new
development. Rubens understood the importance of engraving
as a means of increasing his fame and wealth, and directed
Vorsterman and others. The theory of engraving at that time
was that it ought not to render accurately the local colour of
painting, which would appear wanting in harmony when dissociated
from the hues of the picture; and it was one of the
anxieties of Rubens so to direct his engravers that the result
might be a fine plate independently of what he had painted.
To this end he helped his engravers by drawings, in which he
sometimes indicated what he thought the best direction for the
lines. Rubens liked Vorsterman&rsquo;s work, and scarcely corrected
it, a plate he especially approved being &ldquo;Susannah and the
Elders,&rdquo; which is a learned piece of work well modelled, and
shaded everywhere on the figures and costumes with fine curved
lines, the straight line being reserved for the masonry. Vorsterman
quitted Rubens after executing fourteen important plates,
and was succeeded by Paul Pontius, then a youth of twenty,
who went on engraving from Rubens with increasing skill until
the painter&rsquo;s death. Boetius a Bolswert engraved from Rubens
towards the close of his life, and his brother Schelte a Bolswert
engraved more than sixty compositions of Rubens, of the most
varied character, including hunting scenes and landscapes.
This brings us to the engraving of landscape as a separate study.
Rubens treated landscape in a broad comprehensive manner,
and Schelte&rsquo;s way of engraving it was also broad and comprehensive.
The lines are long and often undulating, the cross-hatchings
bold and rather obtrusive, for they often substitute
unpleasant reticulations for the refinement and mystery of
nature, but it was a beginning, and a vigorous beginning. The
technical developments of engraving under the influence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page723" id="page723"></a>723</span>
Rubens may be summed up briefly as follows: (1) The Italian
outline had been discarded as the chief subject of attention, and
modelling had been substituted for it; (2) broad masses had
been substituted for the minutely finished detail of the northern
schools; (3) a system of light and dark had been adopted which
was not pictorial, but belonged especially to engraving, which it
rendered (in the opinion of Rubens) more harmonious.</p>

<p>The history of line-engraving, from the time of Rubens to the
beginning of the 19th century, is rather that of the vigorous
and energetic application of principles already accepted than any
new development. From the two sources already indicated, the
school of Raphael and the school of Rubens, a double tradition
flowed to England and France, where it mingled and directed
English and French practice. The first influence on English
line-engraving was Flemish, and came from Rubens through
Vandyck, Vorsterman, and others; but the English engravers
soon underwent French and Italian influences, for although
Payne learned from a Fleming, Faithorne studied in France
under Philippe de Champagne the painter and Robert Nanteuil
the engraver. Sir Robert Strange studied in France under
Philippe Lebas, and then five years in Italy, where he saturated
his mind with Italian art. French engravers came to England
as they went to Italy, so that the art of engraving became in the
18th century cosmopolitan. In figure-engraving the outline was
less and less insisted upon. Strange made it his study to soften
and lose the outline. Meanwhile, the great classical Renaissance
school, with Gérard Audran at its head, had carried forward
the art of modelling with the burin, and had arrived at great
perfection of a sober and dignified kind. Audran was very productive
in the latter half of the 17th century, and died in 1703,
after a life of severe self-direction in labour, the best external
influence he underwent being that of the painter Nicolas Poussin.
He made his work more rapid by the use of etching, but kept it
entirely subordinate to the work of the burin. One of the finest
of his large plates is &ldquo;St John Baptizing,&rdquo; from Poussin, with
groups of dignified figures in the foreground and a background of
grand classical landscape, all executed with the most thorough
knowledge according to the ideas of that time. The influence of
Claude Lorrain on the engraving of landscape was exercised less
through his etchings than his pictures, which compelled the engravers
to study delicate distinctions in the values of light and
dark. Through Woollett and Vivarès, Claude exercised an influence
on landscape engraving almost equal to that of Raphael
and Rubens on the engraving of the figure, though he did not
direct his engravers personally.</p>

<p>In the 19th century line-engraving received first an impulse
and finally a check. The impulse came from the growth of public
wealth, the increasing interest in art and the increase in the
commerce of art, which, by means of engraving, fostered in
England mainly by John Boydell, penetrated into the homes of
the middle classes, as well as from the growing demand for
illustrated books, which gave employment to engravers of first-rate
ability. The check to line-engraving came from the desire
for cheaper and more rapid methods, a desire satisfied in various
ways, but especially by etching and by the various kinds of
photography. Nevertheless, the 19th century produced most
highly accomplished work in line-engraving, both in the figure
and in landscape. Its characteristics, in comparison with the
work of other centuries, were chiefly a more thorough and delicate
rendering of local colour, light and shade, and texture. The
elder engravers could draw as correctly as the moderns, but they
either neglected these elements or admitted them sparingly, as
opposed to the spirit of their art. In a modern engraving from
Landseer may be seen the blackness of a man&rsquo;s boots (local
colour), the soft roughness of his coat (texture), and the exact
value in light and dark of his face and costume against the cloudy
sky. Nay more, there is to be found every sparkle on bit, boot
and stirrup. Modern painting pays more attention to texture
and chiaroscuro than classical painting did, and engraving
necessarily followed in the same directions. But there is a certain
sameness in pure line-engraving more favourable to some forms
and textures than to others. This sameness of line-engraving,
and its costliness, led to the adoption of mixed methods, extremely
prevalent in commercial prints from popular artists. In the
well-known prints from Rosa Bonheur, for example, by T. Landseer,
H. T. Ryall, and C. G. Lewis, the tone of the skies is got by
machine-ruling, and so is much undertone in the landscape;
the fur of the animals is all etched, and so are the foreground
plants, the real burin work being used sparingly where most
favourable to texture. Even in the exquisite engravings after
Turner, by Cooke, Goodall, Wallis, Miller, Willmore, and others,
who reached a degree of delicacy in light and shade far surpassing
the work of the old masters, the engravers had recourse to
etching, finishing with the burin and dry point. Turner&rsquo;s name
may be added to those of Raphael, Rubens and Claude in the
list of painters who have had a special influence upon engraving.
The speciality of Turner&rsquo;s influence was in the direction of
delicacy of tone. In this respect the Turner vignettes to Roger&rsquo;s
poems were a high-water mark of human attainment, not likely
ever to be surpassed.</p>

<p>The record of the art of line-engraving during the last quarter
of the 19th century is one of continued decay. Technical improvements,
it was hoped, might save the art; it was thought
by some that the slight revival resultant on the turning back of
the burin&rsquo;s cutting-point&mdash;whereby the operator pulled the
tool towards him instead of pushing it from him&mdash;might effect
much, in virtue of the time and labour saved by the device.
But by the beginning of the 20th century pictorial line-engraving
in England was practically non-existent, and, with the passing
of Jeens and Stacpoole, the spasmodic demand by publishers
for engravers to engrave new plates remained unanswered.
Mr C. W. Sherborn, the exquisite and facile designer and engraver
of book-plates, has scarcely been surpassed in his own line, but
his art is mainly heraldic. There are now no men capable of
such work as that with which Doo, J. H. Robinson, and their
fellows maintained the credit of the English School. Line-engraving
has been killed by etching, mezzotint and the &ldquo;mixed
method.&rdquo; The disappearance of the art is due not so much to
the artistic objection that the personality of the line-engraver
stands obtrusively between the painter and the public; it is
rather that the public refuse to wait for several years for the
proofs for which they have subscribed, when by another method
they can obtain their plates more quickly. An important line
plate may occupy a prodigious time in the engraving; J. H.
Robinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Napoleon and the Pope&rdquo; took about twelve years.
The invention of steel-facing a copper plate would now enable
the engraver to proceed more expeditiously; but even in this
case he can no more compete with the etcher than the mezzotint-engraver
can keep pace with the photogravure manufacturer.</p>

<p>The Art Union of London in the past gave what encouragement
it could; but with the death of J. Stephenson (1886) and
F. Bacon (1887) it was evident that all hope was gone. John
Saddler at the end was driven, in spite of his capacity to do
original work, to spend most of his time in assisting Thomas
Landseer to rule the skies on his plates, simply because there
was not enough line-engraving to do. Since then there was some
promise of a revival, and Mr Bourne engraved a few of the
pictures by Gustave Doré. But little followed. The last of the
line-engravers of Turner&rsquo;s pictures died in the person of Sir
Daniel Wilson (d. 1892), who, recognizing the hopelessness of his
early profession, laid his graver aside, and left Europe for Canada
and eventually became president of the university of Toronto.</p>

<p>If line-engraving still flourishes in France, it is due not a
little to official encouragement and to intelligent fostering by
collectors and connoisseurs. The prizes offered by the École
des Beaux Arts would probably not suffice to give vitality to
the art but for the employment afforded to the finished artist
by the &ldquo;Chalcographie du Musée du Louvre,&rdquo; in the name of
which commissions are judiciously distributed. At the same
time, it must be recognized that not only are French engravers
less busy than they were in days when line-engraving was the
only &ldquo;important&rdquo; method of picture-translation, but they
work for the most part for much smaller rewards. Moreover,
the class of the work has entirely changed, partly through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page724" id="page724"></a>724</span>
reduction of prices paid for it, partly through the change of
taste and fashion, and partly, again, through the necessities
of the situation. That is to say, that public impatience is but
a partial factor in the abandonment of the fine broad sweeping
trough cut deep into the copper which was characteristic of the
earlier engraving, either simply cut or crossed diagonally so as
to form the series of &ldquo;lozenges&rdquo; typical of engraving at its
finest and grandest period. That method was slow; but
scarcely less slow was the shallower work rendered possible by
the steel plate by reason of the much greater degree of elaboration
of which such plates were capable, and which the public
was taught&mdash;mainly by Finden&mdash;to expect. The French
engravers were therefore driven at last to simplify their work
if they were to satisfy the public and live by the burin. To
compensate for loss of colour, the art developed in the direction
of elegance and refinement. Gaillard (d. 1887), Blanchard,
and Alphonse François (d. 1888) were perhaps the earliest
chiefs of the new school, the characteristics of which are the
substitution of exquisite greys for the rich blacks of old, simplicity
of method being often allied to extremely high elaboration.
Yet the aim of the modern engraver has always been, while
pushing the capability of his own art to the farthermost limit,
to retain throughout the individual and personal qualities of
the master whose work is translated on the plate. The height
of perfection to which the art is reached is seen in the triptych
of Mantegna by Achille Jacquet (d. 1909), to whom may perhaps
be accorded the first place among several engravers of the front
rank. This &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; (from the three pictures in the Louvre
and at Tours, forming the predella of the San Zeno altarpiece
in Verona) not only conveys the forms, sentiment, and colour
of the master, but succeeds also in rendering the peculiar luminosity
of the originals. Jacquet, who gained the <i>Prix de Rome</i>
in 1870, also translated pictures of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
and engraved fine plates after Paul Dubois, Cabanel,
Bouguereau, Meissonier and Detaille. The freedom of much
of his work suggests an affinity with etching and dry-point;
indeed, it appears that he uses the etching-needle and acid
to lay in some of his groundwork and outlines. Léopold Flameng&rsquo;s
engraving after Jan van Eyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Virgin with the Donor,&rdquo; in
the Louvre, is one of the most admirable works of its kind,
retaining the quality and sentiment of the master, extreme
minuteness and elaboration notwithstanding. Jules Jacquet
is known for his work after Meissonier (especially the &ldquo;Friedland&rdquo;)
and after Bonnat; Adrien Didier for his plates after
Holbein (&ldquo;Anne of Cleves&rdquo;), Raphael, and Paul Veronese,
among the Old Masters, and Bonnat, Bouguereau, and Roybet
among the new. Jazinski (Botticelli&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primavera&rdquo;), Sulpis
(Mantegna and Gustave Moreau), Patricot (Gustave Moreau),
Burney, and Champollion (d. 1901), have been among the
leaders of the modern school. Their object is to secure the faithful
transcript of the painter they reproduce, while readily
sacrificing the power of the old method, which, whatever its
force and its beauty, was easily acquired by mediocre artists of
technical ability who were nevertheless unable to appreciate
or reproduce anything beyond mechanical excellence.</p>

<p>The Belgian School of engraving is not without vitality.
Gustave Biot was equally skilful in portraiture and subject
(engraving after Gallait, Cabanel, Gustave Doré, among his best
work); A. M. Danse executed plates after leading painters,
and elaborated an effective &ldquo;mixed method&rdquo; of graver-work
and dry-point; and de Meerman has engraved a number
of good plates; but private patronage is hardly sufficient in
Belgium to maintain the school in a state of prosperous
efficiency.</p>

<p>In Germany, as might be expected, line-engraving retains
not a little of its popularity in its more orthodox form. The
novel Stauffer-Bern method, in which freedom and lightness
are obtained with such delicacy that the fine lines, employed
in great numbers, run into tone, and yield a supposed advantage
in modelling, has not been without appreciation. But the more
usual virtue of the graver has been best supported, and many
have worked in the old-fashioned manner. Friedrich Zimmermann
(d. 1887) began his career by engraving such prints as
Guido Reni&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; in Dresden, and then devoted
himself to the translation of modern German painters. Rudolph
Pfnor was an ornamentist representative of his class; and
Joseph Kohlschein, of Düsseldorf, a typical exponent of the
intelligent conservative manner. His &ldquo;Marriage at Cana&rdquo;
after Paul Veronese, &ldquo;The Sistine Madonna&rdquo; after Raphael,
and &ldquo;St Cecilia&rdquo; after the same master, are all plates of a high
order.</p>

<p>In Italy the art is well-nigh as moribund as in England.
When Vittorio Pica (of Naples) and Conconi (of Milan) have
been named, it is difficult to mention other successors to the fine
school of the 19th century which followed Piranesi and Volpato.
A few of the pupils of Rosaspina and Paolo Toschi lived into the
last quarter of the century, but to the present generation Asiolo,
Jesi, C. Raimondi, L. Bigola, and Antonio Isac are remembered
rather for their efforts than for their success in supporting their
art against the combined opposition of etching, &ldquo;process&rdquo;
and public indifference.</p>

<p>Outside Europe line-engraving can no longer be said to exist.
Here and there a spasmodic attempt may be made to appeal to
the artistic appreciation of a limited public; but no general
attention is paid to such efforts, nor, it may be added, are these
inherently worthy of much notice. There are still a few who
can engrave a head from a photograph or drawing, or a small engraving
for book-illustration or for book-plates; there are more
who are highly proficient in mechanical engraving for decorative
purposes; but the engraving-machine is fast superseding this
class. In short, the art of worthily translating a fine painting
beyond the borders of France, Belgium, Germany and perhaps
Italy can scarcely be said to survive, and even in those countries
it appears to exist on sufferance and by hot-house encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINEN<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> and <span class="bold">LINEN MANUFACTURES.</span> Under the name
of linen are comprehended all yarns spun and fabrics woven
from flax fibre (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flax</a></span>).</p>

<p>From the earliest periods of human history till almost the
close of the 18th century the linen manufacture was one of the
most extensive and widely disseminated of the domestic industries
of European countries. The industry was most largely developed
in Russia, Austria, Germany, Holland, Belgium, the northern
provinces of France, and certain parts of England, in the north
of Ireland, and throughout Scotland; and in these countries
its importance was generally recognized by the enactment of
special laws, having for their object the protection and extension
of the trade. The inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves and
Crompton in the later part of the 18th century, benefiting
almost exclusively the art of cotton-spinning, and the unparalleled
development of that branch of textile manufactures, largely
due to the ingenuity of these inventors, gave the linen trade as
it then existed a fatal blow. Domestic spinning, and with it
hand-loom weaving, immediately began to shrink; the trade
which had supported whole villages and provinces entirely
disappeared, and the linen manufacture, in attenuated dimensions
and changed conditions, took refuge in special localities, where
it resisted, not unsuccessfully, the further assaults of cotton,
and, with varying fortunes, rearranged its relations in the community
of textile industries. The linen industries of the United
Kingdom were the first to suffer from the aggression of cotton;
more slowly the influence of the rival textile reached other
countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page725" id="page725"></a>725</span></p>

<p>In 1810 Napoleon I. offered a reward of one million francs
to any inventor who should devise the best machinery for the
spinning of flax yarn. Within a few weeks thereafter Philippe
de Girard patented in France important inventions for flax
spinning by both dry and wet methods. His inventions, however,
did not receive the promised reward and were neglected in his
native country. In 1815 he was invited by the Austrian government
to establish a spinning mill at Hirtenberg near Vienna,
which was run with his machinery for a number of years, but
it failed to prove a commercial success. In the meantime
English inventors had applied themselves to the task of adapting
machines to the preparation and spinning of flax. The foundation
of machine spinning of flax was laid by John Kendrew and
Thomas Porthouse of Darlington, who, in 1787, secured a patent
for &ldquo;a mill or machine upon new principles for spinning yarn
from hemp, tow, flax or wool.&rdquo; By innumerable successive
improvements and modifications, the invention of Kendrew
and Porthouse developed into the perfect system of machinery
with which, at the present day, spinning-mills are furnished;
but progress in adapting flax fibres for mechanical spinning,
and linen yarn for weaving cloth by power-loom was much
slower than in the corresponding case of cotton.</p>

<p>Till comparatively recent times, the sole spinning implements
were the spindle and distaff. The spindle, which is the fundamental
apparatus in all spinning machinery, was a round stick
or rod of wood about 12 in. in length, tapering towards each
extremity, and having at its upper end a notch or slit into
which the yarn might be caught or fixed. In general, a ring
or &ldquo;whorl&rdquo; of stone or clay was passed round the upper part
of the spindle to give it momentum and steadiness when in
rotation, while in some few cases an ordinary potato served
the purpose of a whorl. The distaff, or rock, was a rather longer
and stronger bar or stick, around one end of which, in a loose
coil or ball, the fibrous material to be spun was wound. The
other extremity of the distaff was carried under the left arm,
or fixed in the girdle at the left side, so as to have the coil of
flax in a convenient position for drawing out to form the
yarn. A prepared end of yarn being fixed into the notch, the
spinster, by a smart rolling motion of the spindle with the
right hand against the right leg, threw it out from her, spinning
in the air, while, with the left hand, she drew from the rock
an additional supply of fibre which was formed into a uniform
and equal strand with the right. The yarn being sufficiently
twisted was released from the notch, wound around the lower
part of the spindle, and again fixed in the notch at the point
insufficiently twisted; and so the rotating, twisting and drawing
out operations went on till the spindle was full. So persistent is
an ancient and primitive art of this description that in remote
districts of Scotland&mdash;a country where machine spinning has
attained a high standard&mdash;spinning with rock and spindle is
still practised;<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and yarn of extraordinary delicacy, beauty
and tenacity has been spun by their agency. The first improvement
on the primitive spindle was found in the construction of
the hand-wheel, in which the spindle, mounted in a frame, was
fixed horizontally, and rotated by a band passing round it and
a large wheel, set in the same framework. Such a wheel became
known in Europe about the middle of the 16th century, but it
appears to have been in use for cotton spinning in the East
from time immemorial. At a later date, which cannot be fixed,
the treadle motion was attached to the spinning wheel, enabling
the spinster to sit at work with both hands free; and the introduction
of the two-handed or double-spindle wheel, with flyers or
twisting arms on the spindles, completed the series of mechanical
improvements effected on flax spinning till the end of the 18th
century. The common use of the two-handed wheel throughout
the rural districts of Ireland and Scotland is a matter still within
the recollection of some people; but spinning wheels are now
seldom seen.</p>

<p>The modern manufacture of linen divides itself into two
branches, spinning and weaving, to which may be added the
bleaching and various finishing processes, which, in the case of
many linen textures, are laborious undertakings and important
branches of industry. The flax fibre is received in bundles
from the scutch mill, and after having been classed into various
grades, according to the quality of the material, it is labelled
and placed in the store ready for the flax mill. The whole
operations in yarn manufacture comprise (1) hackling, (2)
preparing and (3) spinning.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Hackling.</i>&mdash;This first preparatory process consists not only in
combing out, disentangling and laying smooth and parallel the
separate fibres, but also serves to split up and separate into their
ultimate filaments the strands of fibre which, up to this point,
have been agglutinated together. The hackling process was
originally performed by hand, and it was one of fundamental importance,
requiring the exercise of much dexterity and judgment.
The broken, ravelled and short fibres, which separate out in the
hackling process, form tow, an article of much inferior value to the
spinner. A good deal of hand-hackling is still practised, especially
in Irish and continental mills; and it has not been found practicable,
in any case, to dispense entirely with a rough preparation of the
fibre by hand labour. In hackling by hand, the hackler takes a
handful or &ldquo;strick&rdquo; of rough flax, winds the top end around his
hands, and then, spreading out the root end as broad and flat as
possible, by a swinging motion dashes the fibre into the hackle
teeth or needles of the rougher or &ldquo;ruffer.&rdquo; The rougher is a board
plated with tin, and studded with spikes or teeth of steel about
7 in. in length, which taper to a fine sharp point. The hackler
draws his strick several times through this tool, working gradually
up from the roots to near his hand, till in his judgment the fibres
at the root end are sufficiently combed out and smoothed. He then
seizes the root end and similarly treats the top end of the strick.
The same process is again repeated on a similar tool, the teeth of
which are 5 in. long, and much more closely studded together;
and for the finer counts of yarn a third and a fourth hackle may be
used, of still increasing fineness and closeness of teeth. In dealing
with certain varieties of the fibre, for fine spinning especially, the
flax is, after roughing, broken or cut into three lengths&mdash;the top,
middle and root ends. Of these the middle cut is most valuable,
being uniform in length, strength and quality. The root end is
more woody and harsh, while the top, though fine in quality, is
uneven and variable in strength. From some flax of extra length it
is possible to take two short middle cuts; and, again, the fibre is
occasionally only broken into two cuts. Flax so prepared is known
as &ldquo;cut line&rdquo; in contradistinction to &ldquo;long line&rdquo; flax, which is
the fibre unbroken. The subsequent treatment of line, whether long
or cut, does not present sufficient variation to require further
reference to these distinctions.</p>

<p>In the case of hackling by machinery, the flax is first roughed
and arranged in stricks, as above described under hand hackling.
In the construction of hackling machines, the general principles of
those now most commonly adopted are identical. The machines
are known as vertical sheet hackling machines, their essential
features being a set of endless leather bands or sheets revolving
over a pair of rollers in a vertical direction. These sheets are crossed
by iron bars, to which hackle stocks, furnished with teeth, are
screwed. The hackle stocks on each separate sheet are of one size
and gauge, but each successive sheet in the length of the machine
is furnished with stocks of increasing fineness, so that the hackling
tool at the end where the flax is entered is the coarsest, say about
four pins per inch, while that to which the fibre is last submitted has
the smallest and most closely set teeth. The finest tools may contain
from 45 to 60 pins per inch. Thus the whole of the endless vertical
revolving sheet presents a continuous series of hackle teeth, and the
machines are furnished with a double set of such sheets revolving
face to face, so close together that the pins of one set of sheets
intersect those on the opposite stocks. Overhead, and exactly
centred between these revolving sheets, is the head or holder channel,
from which the flax hangs down while it is undergoing the hackling
process on both sides. The flax is fastened in a holder consisting of
two heavy flat plates of iron, between which it is spread and tightly
screwed up. The holder is 11 in. in length, and the holder channel
is fitted to contain a line of six, eight or twelve such holders, according
to the number of separate bands of hackling stocks in the machine.
The head or holder channel has a falling and rising motion, by
which it first presents the ends and gradually more and more of the
length of the fibre to the hackle teeth, and, after dipping down the
full length of the fibre exposed, it slowly rises and lifts the flax clear
of the hackle stocks. By a reciprocal motion all the holders are
then moved forward one length; that at the last and finest set of
stocks is thrown out, and place is made for filling in an additional
holder at the beginning of the series. Thus with a six-tool hackle,
or set of stocks, each holder full of flax from beginning to end descends
into and rises from the hackle teeth six times in travelling from
end to end of the machine. The root ends being thus first hackled,
the holders are shot back along an inclined plane, the iron plates
unclamped, the flax reversed, and the top ends are then submitted
to the same hackling operation. The tow made during the hackling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page726" id="page726"></a>726</span>
process is carried down by the pins of the sheet, and is stripped
from them by means of a circular brush placed immediately under
the bottom roller. The brush revolves in the same direction as, but
quicker than the sheet, consequently the tow is withdrawn from
the pins. The tow is then removed from the brush by a doffer
roller, from which it is finally removed by a doffing knife. This
material is then carded by a machine similar to, but finer than, the
one described under Jute (<i>q.v.</i>). The hackled flax, however, is
taken direct to the preparing department.</p>

<p><i>Preparing.</i>&mdash;The various operations in this stage have for their
object the proper assortment of dressed line into qualities fit for
spinning, and the drawing out of the fibres to a perfectly level and
uniform continuous ribbon or sliver, containing throughout an equal
quantity of fibre in any given length. From the hackling the now
smooth, glossy and clean stricks are taken to the sorting room,
where they are assorted into different qualities by the &ldquo;line sorter,&rdquo;
who judges by both eye and touch the quality and capabilities of
the fibre. So sorted, the material is passed to the spreading and
drawing frames, a series or system of machines all similar in construction
and effect. The essential features of the spreading frame
are: (1) the feeding cloth or creeping sheet, which delivers the
flax to (2) a pair of &ldquo;feed and jockey&rdquo; rollers, which pass it on (3)
to the gill frame or fallers. The gill frame consists of a series of
narrow hackle bars, with short closely studded teeth, which travel
between the feed rollers and the drawing or &ldquo;boss and pressing&rdquo;
rollers to be immediately attended to. They are, by an endless
screw arrangement, carried forward at approximately the same
rate at which the flax is delivered to them, and when they reach the
end of their course they fall under, and by a similar screw arrangement
are brought back to the starting-point; and thus they form
an endless moving level toothed platform for carrying away the flax
from the feed rollers. This is the machine in which the fibres are,
for the first time, formed into a continuous length termed a sliver.
In order to form this continuous sliver it is necessary that the short
lengths of flax should overlap each other on the spread sheet or
creeping sheet. This sheet contains four or six divisions, so that
four or six lots of overlapped flax are moving at the same time
towards the first pair of rollers&mdash;the boss rollers or retaining rollers.
The fibre passes between these rollers and is immediately caught by
the rising gills which carry the fibre towards the drawing rollers.
The pins of the gills should pass through the fibre so that they may
have complete control over it, while their speed should be a little
greater than the surface speed of the retaining rollers. The fibre
is thus carried forward to the drawing rollers, which have a surface
speed of from 10 to 30 times that of the retaining rollers. The great
difference between the speeds of the retaining and drawing rollers
results in each sliver being drawn out to a corresponding degree.
Finally all the slivers are run into one and in this state are passed
between the delivery rollers into the sliver cans. Each can should
contain the same length of sliver, a common length being 1000 yds.
A bell is automatically rung by the machine to warn the attendant
that the desired length has been deposited into the can. From the
spreading frame the cans of sliver pass to the drawing frames, where
from four to twelve slivers combined are passed through feed rollers
over gills, and drawn out by drawing rollers to the thickness of one.
A third and fourth similar doubling and drawing may be embraced
in a preparing system, so that the number of doublings the flax
undergoes, before it arrives at the roving frame, may amount to
from one thousand to one hundred thousand, according to the
quality of yarn in progress. Thus, for example, the doublings on
one preparing system may be 6 × 12 × 12 × 12 × 8 = 82,944. The slivers
delivered by the last drawing frame are taken to the roving frame,
where they are singly passed through feed rollers and over gills,
and, after drafting to sufficient tenuity, they are slightly twisted
by flyers and wound on bobbins, in which condition the
material&mdash;termed &ldquo;rove&rdquo; or &ldquo;rovings&rdquo;&mdash;is ready for the spinning
frame.<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><i>Spinning.</i>&mdash;The spinning operation, which follows the roving,
is done in two principal ways, called respectively dry spinning and
wet spinning, the first being used for the lower counts or heavier
yarns, while the second is exclusively adopted in the preparation
of fine yarns. The spinning frame does not differ in principle from
the throstle spinning machine used in cotton manufacture. The
bobbins of flax rove are arranged in rows on each side of the frame
(the spinning frames being all double) on pins in an inclined plane.
The rove passes downwards through an eyelet or guide to a pair of
nipping rollers between which and the final drawing rollers, placed
in the case of dry spinning from 18 to 22 in. lower down, the fibre
receives its final draft while passing over and under cylinders and
guide-plate, and attains that degree of tenuity which the finished
yarn must possess. From the last rollers the now attenuated
material, in passing to the flyers receives the degree of twist which
compacts the fibres into the round hard cord which constitutes spun
yarn; and from the flyers it is wound on the more slowly rotating
spool within the flyer arms, centred on the top of the spindle. The
amount of twist given to the thread at the spinning frame varies
from 1.5 to 2 times the square root of the count. In wet spinning
the general sequence of operations is the same, but the rove, as
unwound from its bobbin, first passes through a trough of water
heated to about 120° Fahr.; and the interval between the two pairs
of rollers in which the drawing out of the rove is accomplished is
very much shorter. The influence of the hot water on the flax
fibre appears to be that it softens the gummy substance which
binds the separate cells together, and thereby allows the elementary
cells to a certain extent to be drawn out without breaking the continuity
of the fibre; and further it makes a finer, smoother and more
uniform strand than can be obtained by dry spinning. The extent
to which the original strick of flax as laid on the feeding roller for
(say) the production of a 50 lea yarn is, by doublings and drawings,
extended, when it reaches the spinning spindle, may be stated
thus: 35 times on spreading frame, 15 times on first drawing
frame, 15 times on second drawing frame, 14 times on third drawing
frame, 15 times on roving frame and 10 times on spinning frame,
in all 16,537,500 times its original length, with 8 × 12 × 16 = 1536
doublings on the three drawing frames. That is to say, 1 yd. of
hackled line fed into the spreading frame is spread out, mixed with
other fibres, to a length of about 9400 m. of yarn, when the above
drafts obtain. The drafts are much shorter for the majority of
yarns.</p>

<p>The next operation is reeling from the bobbins into hanks. By
act of parliament, throughout the United Kingdom the standard
measure of flax yard is the &ldquo;lea,&rdquo; called also in Scotland the &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
of 300 yds. The flax is wound or reeled on a reel having a circumference
of 90 in. (2½ yds.) making &ldquo;a thread,&rdquo; and one hundred and
twenty such threads form a lea. The grist or count of all fine yarns
is estimated by the number of leas in 1 &#8468;; thus &ldquo;50 lea&rdquo;
indicates that there are 50 leas or cuts of 300 yds. each in 1 &#8468; of
the yard so denominated. With the heavier yarns in Scotland the
quality is indicated by their weight per &ldquo;spyndle&rdquo; of 48 cuts or
leas; thus &ldquo;3 &#8468; tow yarn&rdquo; is such as weighs 3 &#8468; per spyndle,
equivalent to &ldquo;16 lea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hanks of yarn from wet spinning are either dried in a loft
with artificial heat or exposed over ropes in the open air. When
dry they are twisted back and forward to take the wiry feeling out
of the yarn, and made up in bundles for the market as &ldquo;grey yarn.&rdquo;
English spinners make up their yarns into &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; of 20 hanks,
each hank containing 10 leas; Irish spinners make hanks of 12 leas,
16<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of which form a bundle; Scottish manufacturers adhere to the
spyndle containing 4 hanks of 12 cuts or leas.</p>

<p>Commercial qualities of yarn range from about 8 &#8468; tow yarns
(6 lea) up to 160 lea line yarn. Very much finer yarn up even to
400 lea may be spun from the system of machines found in many
mills; but these higher counts are only used for fine thread for
sewing and for the making of lace. The highest counts of cut line
flax are spun in Irish mills for the manufacture of fine cambrics
and lawns which are characteristic features of the Ulster trade.
Exceedingly high counts have sometimes been spun by hand, and
for the preparation of the finest lace threads it is said the Belgian
hand spinners must work in damp cellars, where the spinner is
guided by the sense of touch alone, the filament being too fine to be
seen by the eye. Such lace yarn is said to have been sold for as
much as £240 per &#8468;. In the Great Exhibition of 1851, yarn of 760
lea, equal to about 130 m. per &#8468;, was shown which had been spun
by an Irish woman eighty-four years of age. In the same exhibition
there was shown by a Cambray manufacturing firm hand-spun yarn
equal to 1200 warp and 1600 weft or to more than 204 and 272 m.
per &#8468; respectively.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bleaching.</i>&mdash;A large proportion of the linen yarn of commerce
undergoes a more or less thorough bleaching before it is handed
over to the weaver. Linen yarns in the green condition contain
such a large proportion of gummy and resinous matter, removable
by bleaching, that cloths which might present a firm close
texture in their natural unbleached state would become thin and
impoverished in a perfectly bleached condition. Nevertheless,
in many cases it is much more satisfactory to weave the yarns
in the green or natural colour, and to perform all bleaching
operations in the piece. Manufacturers allow about 20 to 25%
of loss in weight of yarn in bleaching from the green to the
fully bleached stage; and the intermediate stages of boiled,
improved, duck, cream, half bleach and three-quarters bleach,
all indicating a certain degree of bleaching, have corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page727" id="page727"></a>727</span>
degrees of loss in weight. The differences in colour resulting
from different degrees of bleaching are taken advantage of for
producing patterns in certain classes of linen fabrics.</p>

<p>Linen thread is prepared from the various counts of fine
bleached line yarn by winding the hanks on large spools, and
twisting the various strands, two, three, four or six cord as the
case may be, on a doubling spindle similar in principle to the yarn
spinning frame, excepting, of course, the drawing rollers. A
large trade in linen thread has been created by its use in the
machine manufacture of boots and shoes, saddlery and other
leather goods, and in heavy sewing-machine work generally.
The thread industry is largely developed at Lisburn near Belfast,
at Johnstone near Glasgow, Bridport, Dorsetshire, and at
Paterson, New Jersey, United States. Fine cords, net twine
and ropes are also twisted from flax.</p>

<p>Weaving.&mdash;The difficulties in the way of power-loom linen
weaving, combined with the obstinate competition of hand-loom
weavers, delayed the introduction of factory weaving of linen
fabrics for many years after the system was fully applied to other
textiles. The principal difficulty arose through the hardness and
inelasticity of the linen yarns, owing to which the yarn frequently
broke under the tension to which it was subjected. Competition
with the hand-loom against the power-loom in certain classes of
work is conceivable, although it is absolutely impossible for the
work of the spinning wheel to stand against the rivalry of drawing,
roving and spinning frames. To the present day, in Ireland
especially, a great deal of fine weaving is done by hand-loom.
Warden states that power was applied on a small scale to the
weaving of canvas in London about 1812; that in 1821 power-looms
were started for weaving linen at Kirkcaldy, Scotland;
and that in 1824 Maberly &amp; Co. of Aberdeen had two hundred
power-looms erected for linen manufacture.
The power-loom has been in
uninterrupted use in the Broadford
factory, Aberdeen, which then belonged
to Maberly &amp; Co., down to the
present day, and that firm may be
credited with being the effective introducers
of power-loom weaving in
the linen trade.</p>

<p>The various operations connected
with linen weaving, such as winding,
warping, dressing, beaming and drawing-in,
do not differ in essential features
from the like processes in the case of
cotton weaving, &amp;c., neither is there any significant modification
in the looms employed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Weaving</a></span>). Dressing is a matter of
importance in the preparation of linen warps for beaming. It
consists in treating the spread yarn with flour or farina paste,
applied to it by flannel-covered rollers, the lowermost of which
revolves in a trough of paste. The paste is equalized on the
yarn by brushes, and dried by passing the web over steam-heated
cylinders before it is finally wound on the beam for weaving.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Linen fabrics are numerous in variety and widely different in
their qualities, appearance and applications, ranging from heavy
sail-cloth and rough sacking to the most delicate cambrics,
lawns and scrims. The heavier manufactures include as
<span class="sidenote">Fabrics.</span>
a principal item sail-cloth, with canvas, tarpaulin, sacking and
carpeting. The principal seats of the manufacture of these linens are
Dundee, Arbroath, Forfar, Kirkcaldy, Aberdeen and Barnsley.
The medium weight linens, which are used for a great variety of
purposes, such as tent-making, towelling, covers, outer garments
for men, linings, upholstery work, &amp;c., include duck, huckaback,
crash, tick, dowlas, osnaburg, low sheetings and low brown linens.
Plain bleached linens form a class by themselves, and include
principally the materials for shirts and collars and for bed sheets.
Under the head of twilled linens are included drills, diapers and
dimity for household use; and damasks for table linen, of which
two kinds are distinguished&mdash;single or five-leaf damask, and double
or eight-leaf damask, the pattern being formed by the intersection
of warp and weft yarns at intervals of five and eight threads of yarn
respectively. The fine linens are cambrics, lawns and handkerchiefs;
and lastly, printed and dyed linen fabrics may be assigned to a
special though not important class. In a general way it may be
said regarding the British industry that the heavy linen trade centres
in Dundee; medium goods are made in most linen manufacturing
districts; damasks are chiefly produced in Belfast, Dunfermline and
Perth; and the fine linen manufactures have their seat in Belfast
and the north of Ireland. Leeds and Barnsley are the centres of
the linen trade in England.</p>

<p>Linen fabrics have several advantages over cotton, resulting
principally from the microscopic structure and length of the flax
fibre. The cloth is much smoother and more lustrous than cotton
cloth; and, presenting a less &ldquo;woolly&rdquo; surface, it does not soil so
readily, nor absorb and retain moisture so freely, as the more spongy
cotton; and it is at once a cool, clean and healthful material for
bed-sheeting and clothing. Bleached linen, starched and dressed,
possesses that unequalled purity, gloss and smoothness which
make it alone the material suitable for shirt-fronts, collars and
wristbands; and the gossamer delicacy, yet strength, of the thread
it may be spun into fits it for the fine lace-making to which it is
devoted. Flax is a slightly heavier material than cotton, while
its strength is about double.</p>

<p><a name="ft2i" id="ft2i" href="#fa2i"><span class="fn">2</span></a> The preparation of tow for spinning differs in essential features
from the processes above described. Tow from different sources,
such as scutching tow, hackle tow, &amp;c. differs considerably in
quality and value, some being very impure, filled with woody shives
&amp;c., while other kinds are comparatively open and clean. A preliminary
opening and cleaning is necessary for the dirty much-matted
tows, and in general thereafter they are passed through two
carding engines called respectively the breaker and the finisher
cards till the slivers from their processes are ready for the drawing
and roving frames. In the case of fine clean tows, on the other
hand, passing through a single carding engine may be sufficient.
The processes which follow the carding do not differ materially from
those followed in the preparation of rove from line flax.</p>

The practice of distinguishing between vessels fit, and those not
fit, to &ldquo;lie in a line of battle,&rdquo; arose towards the end of the
17th century. In the early 18th century all vessels of 50
guns and upwards were considered fit to lie in a line. After
the Seven Years&rsquo; War (1756-63) the 50-gun ships were
rejected as too small. When the great revolutionary wars
broke out the smallest line of battle ship was of 64 guns.
These also came to be considered as too small, and later the
line of battle-ships began with those of 74 guns. The term is
now replaced by &ldquo;battleship&rdquo;; &ldquo;liner&rdquo; being the colloquial
name given to the great passenger ships used on the main lines

<p><span class="bold">LING, PER HENRIK<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1776-1839), Swedish medical-gymnastic
practitioner, son of a minister, was born at Ljunga in the south
of Sweden in 1776. He studied divinity, and took his degree
in 1797, but then went abroad for some years, first to Copenhagen,
where he taught modern languages, and then to Germany,
France and England. Pecuniary straits injured his health, and
he suffered much from rheumatism, but he had acquired meanwhile
considerable proficiency in gymnastics and fencing. In
1804 he returned to Sweden, and established himself as a teacher
in these arts at Lund, being appointed in 1805 fencing-master
to the university. He found that his daily exercises had completely
restored his bodily health, and his thoughts now turned
towards applying this experience for the benefit of others. He
attended the classes on anatomy and physiology, and went
through the entire curriculum for the training of a doctor; he
then elaborated a system of gymnastics, divided into four
branches, (1) pedagogical, (2) medical, (3) military, (4) aesthetic,
which carried out his theories. After several attempts to interest
the Swedish government, Ling at last in 1813 obtained their
co-operation, and the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute, for the
training of gymnastic instructors, was opened in Stockholm,
with himself as principal. The orthodox medical practitioners
were naturally opposed to the larger claims made by Ling and
his pupils respecting the cure of diseases&mdash;so far at least as
anything more than the occasional benefit of some form of skilfully
applied &ldquo;massage&rdquo; was concerned; but the fact that in
1831 Ling was elected a member of the Swedish General Medical
Association shows that in his own country at all events his
methods were regarded as consistent with professional recognition.
Ling died in 1839, having previously named as the
repositories of his teaching his pupils Lars Gabriel Branting
(1799-1881), who succeeded him as principal of the Institute,
and Karl Augustus Georgii, who became sub-director; his son,
Hjalmar Ling (1820-1886), being for many years associated with
them. All these, together with Major Thure Brandt, who from
about 1861 specialized in the treatment of women (gynecological
gymnastics), are regarded as the pioneers of Swedish medical
gymnastics.</p>

<p>It may be convenient to summarize here the later history of
Ling&rsquo;s system of medical gymnastics. A <i>Gymnastic Orthopaedic
Institute</i> at Stockholm was founded in 1822 by Dr Nils Åkerman,
and after 1827 received a government grant; and Dr Gustaf
Zander elaborated a medico-mechanical system of gymnastics,
known by his name, about 1857, and started his Zander Institute
at Stockholm in 1865. At the Stockholm Gymnastic Central
Institute qualified medical men have supervised the medical
department since 1864; the course is three years (one year
for qualified doctors). Broadly speaking, there have been two
streams of development in the Swedish gymnastics founded on
Ling&rsquo;s beginnings&mdash;either in a conservative direction, making
certain forms of gymnastic exercises subsidiary to the prescriptions
of orthodox medical science, or else in an extremely
progressive direction, making these exercises a substitute for
any other treatment, and claiming them as a cure for disease
by themselves. Modern medical science recognizes fully the
importance of properly selected exercises in preserving the
body from many ailments; but the more extreme claim, which
rules out the use of drugs in disease altogether, has naturally
not been admitted. Modern professed disciples of Ling
are divided, the representative of the more extreme section
being Henrik Kellgren (b. 1837), who has a special school and
following.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Ling and his earlier assistants left no proper written account of
their treatment, and most of the literature on the subject is repudiated
by one set or other of the gymnastic practitioners. Dr
Anders Wide, M.D., of Stockholm, has published a <i>Handbook of
Medical Gymnastics</i> (English edition, 1899), representing the more
conservative practice. Henrik Kellgren&rsquo;s system, which, though
based on Ling&rsquo;s, admittedly goes beyond it, is described in <i>The
Elements of Kellgren&rsquo;s Manual Treatment</i> (1903), by Edgar F. Cyriax,
who before taking the M.D. degree at Edinburgh had passed out of
the Stockholm Institute as a &ldquo;gymnastic director.&rdquo; See also the
encyclopaedic work on <i>Sweden: its People and Industry</i> (1904),
p. 348, edited by G. Sundbärg for the Swedish government.</p>

readily recognized by its long body, two dorsal fins (of which the
anterior is much shorter than the posterior), single long anal
fin, separate caudal fin, a barbel on the chin and large teeth in
the lower jaw and on the palate. Its usual length is from 3 to
4 ft., but individuals of 5 or 6 ft. in length, and some 70 &#8468; in
weight, have been taken. The ling is found in the North Atlantic,
from Spitzbergen and Iceland southwards to the coast of Portugal.
Its proper home is the North Sea, especially on the coasts of
Norway, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland, it occurs in great
abundance, generally at some distance from the land, in depths
varying between 50 and 100 fathoms. During the winter months
it approaches the shores, when great numbers are caught by means
of long lines. On the American side of the Atlantic it is less
common, although generally distributed along the south coast
of Greenland and on the banks of Newfoundland. Ling is one
of the most valuable species of the cod-fish family; a certain
number are consumed fresh, but by far the greater portion are
prepared for exportation to various countries (Germany, Spain,
Italy). They are either salted and sold as &ldquo;salt-fish,&rdquo; or split
from head to tail and dried, forming, with similarly prepared
cod and coal-fish, the article of which during Lent immense
quantities are consumed in Germany and elsewhere under the
name of &ldquo;stock-fish.&rdquo; The oil is frequently extracted from the
liver and used by the poorer classes of the coast population for
the lamp or as medicine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINGARD, JOHN<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1771-1851), English historian, was born on
the 5th of February 1771 at Winchester, where his father, of
an ancient Lincolnshire peasant stock, had established himself
as a carpenter. The boy&rsquo;s talents attracted attention, and in
1782 he was sent to the English college at Douai, where he
continued until shortly after the declaration of war by England
(1793). He then lived as tutor in the family of Lord Stourton,
but in October 1794 he settled along with seven other former
members of the old Douai college at Crook Hall near Durham,
where on the completion of his theological course he became vice-president
of the reorganized seminary. In 1795 he was ordained
priest, and soon afterwards undertook the charge of the chairs of
natural and moral philosophy. In 1808 he accompanied the
community of Crook Hall to the new college at Ushaw, Durham,
but in 1811, after declining the presidency of the college at
Maynooth, he withdrew to the secluded mission at Hornby in
Lancashire, where for the rest of his life he devoted himself to
literary pursuits. In 1817 he visited Rome, where he made
researches in the Vatican Library. In 1821 Pope Pius VII.
created him doctor of divinity and of canon and civil law; and
in 1825 Leo XII. is said to have made him cardinal <i>in petto</i>. He
died at Hornby on the 17th of July 1851.</p>

<p>Lingard wrote <i>The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</i> (1806),
of which a third and greatly enlarged addition appeared in 1845
under the title <i>The History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon
Church; containing an account of its origin, government, doctrines,
worship, revenues, and clerical and monastic institutions</i>; but the
work with which his name is chiefly associated is <i>A History of
England, from the first invasion by the Romans to the commencement of
the reign of William III.</i>, which appeared originally in 8 vols. at
intervals between 1819 and 1830. Three successive subsequent
editions had the benefit of extensive revision by the author; a
fifth edition in 10 vols. 8vo appeared in 1849, and a sixth, with life
of the author by Tierney prefixed to vol. x., in 1854-1855. Soon
after its appearance it was translated into French, German and
Italian. It is a work of ability and research; and, though Cardinal
Wiseman&rsquo;s claim for its author that he was &ldquo;the only impartial
historian of our country&rdquo; may be disregarded, the book remains
interesting as representing the view taken of certain events in
English history by a devout, but able and learned, Roman Catholic
in the earlier part of the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINGEN, RALPH ROBERT WHEELER LINGEN,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span>
(1819-1905), English civil servant, was born in February 1819 at
Birmingham, where his father, who came of an old Hertfordshire
family, with Royalist traditions, was in business. He became a
scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1837; won the Ireland
(1838) and Hertford (1839) scholarships; and after taking a
first-class in <i>Literae Humaniores</i> (1840), was elected a fellow of
Balliol (1841). He subsequently won the Chancellor&rsquo;s Latin
Essay (1843) and the Eldon Law scholarship (1846). After taking
his degree in 1840, he became a student of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and was
called to the bar in 1847; but instead of practising as a barrister,
he accepted an appointment in the Education Office, and after a
short period was chosen in 1849 to succeed Sir J. Kay Shuttleworth
as its secretary or chief permanent official. He retained
this position till 1869. The Education Office of that day had to
administer a somewhat chaotic system of government grants to
local schools, and Lingen was conspicuous for his fearless discrimination
and rigid economy, qualities which characterized
his whole career. When Robert Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke) became,
as vice-president of the council, his parliamentary chief, Lingen
worked congenially with him in producing the Revised Code of
1862 which incorporated &ldquo;payment by results&rdquo;; but the
education department encountered adverse criticism, and in
1864 the vote of censure in parliament which caused Lowe&rsquo;s
resignation, founded (but erroneously) on an alleged &ldquo;editing&rdquo;
of the school inspectors&rsquo; reports, was inspired by a certain
antagonism to Lingen&rsquo;s as well as to Lowe&rsquo;s methods. Shortly
before the introduction of Forster&rsquo;s Education Act of 1870, he
was transferred to the post of permanent secretary of the
treasury. In this office, which he held till 1885, he proved a
most efficient guardian of the public purse, and he was a tower
of strength to successive chancellors of the exchequer. It used
to be said that the best recommendation for a secretary of the
treasury was to be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; so disagreeably that
nobody would court a repetition. Lingen was at all events a
most successful resister of importunate claims, and his undoubted
talents as a financier were most prominently displayed
in the direction of parsimony. In 1885 he retired. He had
been made a C.B. in 1869 and a K.C.B. in 1878, and on his retirement
he was created Baron Lingen. In 1889 he was made one
of the first aldermen of the new London County Council, but
he resigned in 1892. He died on the 22nd of July 1905. He
had married in 1852, but left no issue.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINGEN,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> a town in the Prussian province of Hanover, on the
Ems canal, 43 m. N.N.W. of Münster by rail. Pop. 7500. It has
iron foundries, machinery factories, railway workshops and a
considerable trade in cattle, and among its other industries are
weaving and malting and the manufacture of cloth. Lingen was
the seat of a university from 1685 to 1819.</p>

<p>The county of Lingen, of which this town was the capital, was
united in the middle ages with the county of Treklenburg. In
1508, however, it was separated from this and was divided into
an upper and a lower county, but the two were united in 1541.
A little, later Lingen was sold to the emperor Charles V., from
whom it passed to his son, Philip II. of Spain, who ceded it
in 1507 to Maurice, prince of Orange. After the death of the
English king, William III., in 1702, it passed to Frederick I.,
king of Prussia, and in 1815 the lower county was transferred to
Hanover, only to be united again with Prussia in 1866.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINGUET, SIMON NICHOLAS HENRI<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1736-1794), French
journalist and advocate, was born on the 14th of July 1736,
at Reims, whither his father, the assistant principal in the
Collège de Beauvais of Paris, had recently been exiled by <i>lettre
de cachet</i> for engaging in the Jansenist controversy. He attended
the Collège de Beauvais and won the three highest prizes there
in 1751. He accompanied the count palatine of Zweibrücken
to Poland, and on his return to Paris he devoted himself to
writing. He published partial French translations of Calderon
and Lope de Vega, and wrote parodies for the <i>Opéra Comique</i>
and pamphlets in favour of the Jesuits. Received at first in
the ranks of the <i>philosophes</i>, he soon went over to their opponents,
possibly more from contempt than from conviction, the immediate
occasion for his change being a quarrel with d&rsquo;Alembert in 1762.
Thenceforth he violently attacked whatever was considered
modern and enlightened, and while he delighted society with
his numerous sensational pamphlets, he aroused the fear and
hatred of his opponents by his stinging wit. He was admitted
to the bar in 1764, and soon became one of the most famous
pleaders of his century. But in spite of his brilliant ability
and his record of having lost but two cases, the bitter attacks
which he directed against his fellow advocates, especially against
Gerbier (1725-1788), caused his dismissal from the bar in 1775.
He then turned to journalism and began the <i>Journal de politique
et de littérature</i>, which he employed for two years in literary,
philosophical and legal criticisms. But a sarcastic article on
the French Academy compelled him to turn over the Journal
to La Harpe and seek refuge abroad. Linguet, however, continued
his career of free lance, now attacking and now supporting
the government, in the <i>Annales politiques, civiles et littéraires</i>,
published from 1777 to 1792, first at London, then at Brussels
and finally at Paris. Attempting to return to France in 1780
he was arrested for a caustic attack on the duc de Duras (1715-1789),
an academician and marshal of France, and imprisoned
nearly two years in the Bastille. He then went to London,
and thence to Brussels, where, for his support of the reforms
of Joseph II., he was ennobled and granted an honorarium of
one thousand ducats. In 1786 he was permitted by Vergennes
to return to France as an Austrian counsellor of state, and to
sue the duc d&rsquo;Aiguillon (1730-1798), the former minister of
Louis XV., for fees due him for legal services rendered some
fifteen years earlier. He obtained judgment to the amount of
24,000 livres. Linguet received the support of Marie Antoinette;
his fame at the time surpassed that of his rival Beaumarchais,
and almost excelled that of Voltaire. Shortly afterwards he
visited the emperor at Vienna to plead the case of Van der
Noot and the rebels of Brabant. During the early years of the
Revolution he issued several pamphlets against Mirabeau,
who returned his ill-will with interest, calling him &ldquo;the ignorant
and bombastic M. Linguet, advocate of Neros, sultans and
viziers.&rdquo; On his return to Paris in 1791 he defended the rights
of San Domingo before the National Assembly. His last work
was a defence of Louis XVI. He retired to Marnes near Ville
d&rsquo;Avray to escape the Terror, but was sought out and summarily
condemned to death &ldquo;for having flattered the despots of Vienna
and London.&rdquo; He was guillotined at Paris on the 27th of June
1794.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Linguet was a prolific writer in many fields. Examples of his
attempted historical writing are <i>Histoire du siècle d&rsquo;Alexandre le
Grand</i> (Amsterdam, 1762), and <i>Histoire impartiale des Jésuites</i>
(Madrid, 1768), the latter condemned to be burned. His opposition
to the <i>philosophes</i> had its strongest expressions in <i>Fanatisme des
philosophes</i> (Geneva and Paris, 1764) and <i>Histoire des révolutions de</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page730" id="page730"></a>730</span>
<i>l&rsquo;empire romain</i> (Paris, 1766-1768). His <i>Théorie des lois civiles</i>
(London, 1767) is a vigorous defence of absolutism and attack on
the politics of Montesquieu. His best legal treatise is <i>Mémoire pour
le comte de Morangies</i> (Paris, 1772); Linguet&rsquo;s imprisonment in the
Bastille afforded him the opportunity of writing his <i>Mémoires sur la
Bastille</i>, first published in London in 1789; it has been translated
into English (Dublin, 1783, and Edinburgh, 1884-1887), and is the
best of his works though untrustworthy.</p>

the loops of which a chain is composed; used as a measure of
length in surveying, being <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>th part of a &ldquo;chain.&rdquo; In Gunter&rsquo;s
chain, a &ldquo;link&rdquo; = 7.92 in.; the chain used by American
engineers consists of 100 links of a foot each in length (for &ldquo;link
work&rdquo; and &ldquo;link motions&rdquo; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mechanics</a></span>: § <i>Applied</i>, and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Steam Engine</a></span>). The term is also applied to anything used for
connecting or binding together, metaphorically or absolutely.
(2) (O. Eng. <i>hlinc</i>, possibly from the root which appears in &ldquo;to
lean&rdquo;), a bank or ridge of rising ground; in Scots dialect, in
the plural, applied to the ground bordering on the sea-shore,
characterized by sand and coarse grass; hence a course for
playing golf. (3) A torch made of pitch or tow formerly carried
in the streets to light passengers, by men or boys called &ldquo;link-boys&rdquo;
who plied for hire with them. Iron link-stands supporting
a ring in which the link might be placed may still be seen at
the doorways of old London houses. The word is of doubtful
origin. It has been referred to a Med. Lat. <i>lichinus</i>, which
occurs in the form <i>linchinus</i> (see Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>); this,
according to a 15th-century glossary, meant a wick or match.
It is an adaptation of Gr. <span class="grk" title="luchnos">&#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, lamp. Another suggestion
connects it with a supposed derivation of &ldquo;linstock,&rdquo; from &ldquo;lint.&rdquo;
<i>The New English Dictionary</i> thinks the likeliest suggestion is
to identify the word with the &ldquo;link&rdquo; of a chain. The tow and
pitch may have been manufactured in lengths, and then cut
into sections or &ldquo;links.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINKÖPING,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> a city of Sweden, the seat of a bishop, and chief
town of the district (<i>län</i>) of Östergötland. Pop. (1900) 14,552.
It is situated in a fertile plain 142 m. by rail S.W. of Stockholm,
and communicates with Lake Roxen (½ m. to the north) and the
Göta and Kinda canals by means of the navigable Stångå.
The cathedral (1150-1499), a Romanesque building with a
beautiful south portal and a Gothic choir, is, next to the cathedral
of Upsala, the largest church in Sweden. It contains an altarpiece
by Martin Heemskerck (d. 1574), which is said to have
been bought by John II. for twelve hundred measures of wheat.
In the church of St Lars are some paintings by Per Horberg
(1746-1816), the Swedish peasant artist. Other buildings of
note are the massive episcopal palace (1470-1500), afterwards
a royal palace, and the old gymnasium founded by Gustavus
Adolphus in 1627, which contains the valuable library of old
books and manuscripts belonging to the diocese and state college,
and collection of coins and antiquities. There is also the
Östergötland Museum, with an art collection. The town has
manufactures of tobacco, cloth and hosiery. It is the headquarters
of the second army division.</p>

<p>Linköping early became a place of mark, and was already a
bishop&rsquo;s see in 1082. It was at a council held in the town in
1153 that the payment of Peter&rsquo;s pence was agreed to at the
instigation of Nicholas Breakspeare, afterwards Adrian IV.
The coronation of Birger Jarlsson Valdemar took place in the
cathedral in 1251; and in the reign of Gustavus Vasa several
important diets were held in the town. At Stångåbro (Stångå
Bridge), close by, an obelisk (1898) commemorates the battle of
Stångåbro (1598), when Duke Charles (Protestant) defeated
the Roman Catholic Sigismund. A circle of stones in the Iron
Market of Linköping marks the spot where Sigismund&rsquo;s adherents
were beheaded in 1600.</p>

at Wells, Somerset, and studied music at Bath, where he settled
as a singing-master and conductor of the concerts. From 1774
he was engaged in the management at Drury Lane theatre,
London, composing or compiling the music of many of the pieces
produced there, besides songs and madrigals, which rank high
among English compositions. He died in London on the 19th
of November 1795. His eldest son <span class="sc">Thomas</span> (1756-1778) was a
remarkable violinist, and also a composer, who assisted his father;
and he became a warm friend of Mozart. His works, with some
of his father&rsquo;s, were published in two volumes, and these contain
some lovely madrigals and songs. Another son, <span class="sc">William</span>

literature and music and composed glees and songs. Three
daughters were similarly gifted, and were remarkable both for

<p><span class="bold">LINLITHGOW, JOHN ADRIAN LOUIS HOPE<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span>, <span class="sc">1st Marquess
of</span> (1860-1908), British administrator, was the son of the 6th earl
of Hopetoun. The Hope family traced their descent to John de
Hope, who accompanied James V.&rsquo;s queen Madeleine of Valois
from France to Scotland in 1537, and of whose great-grandchildren
Sir Thomas Hope (d. 1646), lord advocate of Scotland,
was ancestor of the earls of Hopetoun, while Henry Hope settled
in Amsterdam, and was the ancestor of the famous Dutch
bankers of that name, and of the later Hopes of Bedgebury,
Kent. Sir Thomas&rsquo;s son, Sir James Hope of Hopetoun (1614-1661),
Scottish lord of session, was grandfather of Charles, 1st
earl of Hopetoun in the Scots peerage (1681-1742), who was
created earl in 1703; and his grandson, the 3rd earl, was in 1809
made a baron of the United Kingdom. John, the 4th earl (1765-1823),
brother of the 3rd earl, was a distinguished soldier, who
for his services in the Peninsular War was created Baron Niddry
in 1814 before succeeding to the earldom. The marquessate of
Linlithgow was bestowed on the 7th earl of Hopetoun in 1902, in
recognition of his success as first governor (1900-1902) of the
commonwealth of Australia; he died on the 1st of March 1908,
being succeeded as 2nd marquess by his eldest son (b. 1887).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An earldom of Linlithgow was in existence from 1600 to 1716,
this being held by the Livingstones, a Scottish family descended
from Sir William Livingstone. Sir William obtained the barony of
Callendar in 1346, and his descendant, Sir Alexander Livingstone
(d. <i>c.</i> 1450), and other members of this family were specially prominent
during the minority of King James II. Alexander Livingstone,
7th Lord Livingstone (d. 1623), the eldest son of William,
the 6th lord (d. <i>c.</i> 1580), a supporter of Mary, queen of Scots, was a
leading Scottish noble during the reign of James VI. and was created
earl of Linlithgow in 1600. Alexander&rsquo;s grandson, George, 3rd earl
of Linlithgow (1616-1690), and the latter&rsquo;s son, George, the 4th earl
(<i>c.</i> 1652-1695), were both engaged against the Covenanters during
the reign of Charles II. When the 4th earl died without sons in
August 1695 the earldom passed to his nephew, James Livingstone,
4th earl of Callendar. James, who then became the 5th earl of
Linlithgow, joined the Stuart rising in 1715; in 1716 he was
attainted, being thus deprived of all his honours, and he died
without sons in Rome in April 1723.</p>

<p>The earldom of Callendar, which was thus united with that of
Linlithgow, was bestowed in 1641 upon James Livingstone, the third
son of the 1st earl of Linlithgow. Having seen military service in
Germany and the Netherlands, James was created Lord Livingstone
of Almond in 1633 by Charles I., and eight years later the king
wished to make him lord high treasurer of Scotland. Before this,
however, Almond had acted with the Covenanters, and during the
short war between England and Scotland in 1640 he served under
General Alexander Leslie, afterwards earl of Leven. But the trust
reposed in him by the Covenanters did not prevent him in 1640
from signing the &ldquo;band of Cumbernauld,&rdquo; an association for defence
against Argyll, or from being in some way mixed up with the
&ldquo;Incident,&rdquo; a plot for the seizure of the Covenanting leaders,
Hamilton and Argyll. In 1641 Almond became an earl, and,
having declined the offer of a high position in the army raised by
Charles I., he led a division of the Scottish forces into England in
1644 and helped Leven to capture Newcastle. In 1645 Callendar,
who often imagined himself slighted, left the army, and in 1647 he
was one of the promoters of the &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; for the release of
the king. In 1648, when the Scots marched into England, he served
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page731" id="page731"></a>731</span>
as lieutenant-general under the duke of Hamilton, but the duke
found him as difficult to work with as Leven had done previously,
and his advice was mainly responsible for the defeat at Preston.
After this battle he escaped to Holland. In 1650 he was allowed to
return to Scotland, but in 1654 his estates were seized and he was
imprisoned; he came into prominence once more at the Restoration.
Callendar died on March 1674, leaving no children, and, according
to a special remainder, he was succeeded in the earldom by his
nephew Alexander (d. 1685), the second son of the 2nd earl of
Linlithgow; and he again was succeeded by his nephew Alexander
(d. 1692), the second son of the 3rd earl of Linlithgow. The 3rd
earl&rsquo;s son, James, the 4th earl, then became 5th earl of Linlithgow
(see <i>supra</i>).</p>

county town of Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 4279.
It lies in a valley on the south side of a loch, 17½ m. W. of Edinburgh
by the North British railway. It long preserved an
antique and picturesque appearance, with gardens running
down to the lake, or climbing the lower slopes of the rising
ground, but in the 19th century much of it was rebuilt. About
4 m. S. by W. lies the old village of Torphichen (pop. 540),
where the Knights of St John of Jerusalem had their chief
Scottish preceptory. The parish kirk is built on the site of the
nave of the church of the establishment, but the ruins of the
transept and of part of the choir still exist. Linlithgow belongs
to the Falkirk district group of parliamentary burghs with
Falkirk, Airdrie, Hamilton and Lanark. The industries include
shoe-making, tanning and currying, manufactures of paper, glue
and soap, and distilling. An old tower-like structure near the
railway station is traditionally regarded as a mansion of the
Knights Templar. Other public buildings are the first town
house (erected in 1668 and restored in 1848 after a fire); the town
hall, built in 1888; the county buildings and the burgh school,
dating from the pre-Reformation period. There are some fine
fountains. The Cross Well in front of the town house, a striking
piece of grotesque work carved in stone, originally built in the
reign of James V., was rebuilt in 1807. Another fountain is
surmounted by the figure of St Michael, the patron-saint of the
burgh. Linlithgow Palace is perhaps the finest ruin of its kind
in Scotland. Heavy but effective, the sombre walls rise above
the green knolls of the promontory which divides the lake into
two nearly equal portions. In plan it is almost square (168 ft. by
174 ft.), enclosing a court (91 ft. by 88 ft.), in the centre of which
stands the ruined fountain of which an exquisite copy was erected
in front of Holyrood Palace by the Prince Consort. At each
corner there is a tower with an internal spiral staircase, that of
the north-west angle being crowned by a little octagonal turret
known as &ldquo;Queen Margaret&rsquo;s Bower,&rdquo; from the tradition that
it was there that the consort of James IV. watched and waited
for his return from Flodden. The west side, whose massive
masonry, hardly broken by a single window, is supposed to date
in part from the time of James III., who later took refuge in one
of its vaults from his disloyal nobles; but the larger part of the
south and east side belongs to the period of James V., about
1535; and the north side was rebuilt in 1619-1620 by James VI.
Of James V.&rsquo;s portion, architecturally the richest, the main
apartments are the Lyon chamber or parliament hall and the
chapel royal. The grand entrance, approached by a drawbridge,
was on the east side; above the gateway are still some weather-worn
remains of rich allegorical designs. The palace was reduced
to ruins by General Hawley&rsquo;s dragoons, who set fire to it in 1746.
Government grants have stayed further dilapidation. A few
yards to the south of the palace is the church of St Michael, a
Gothic (Scottish Decorated) building (180 ft. long internally
excluding the apse, by 62 ft. in breadth excluding the transepts),
probably founded by David I. in 1242, but mainly built by George
Crichton, bishop of Dunkeld (1528-1536). The central west
front steeple was till 1821 topped by a crown like that of St
Giles&rsquo;, Edinburgh. The chief features of the church are the embattled
and pinnacled tower, with the fine doorway below, the
nave, the north porch and the flamboyant window in the south
transept. The church contains some fine stained glass, including
a window to the memory of Sir Charles Wyville Thomson (1830-1882),
the naturalist, who was born in the parish.</p>

<p>Linlithgow (wrongly identified with the Roman <i>Lindum</i>) was
made a royal burgh by David I. Edward I. encamped here the
night before the battle of Falkirk (1298), wintered here in 1301,
and next year built &ldquo;a pele [castle] mekill and strong,&rdquo; which in
1313 was captured by the Scots through the assistance of William
Bunnock, or Binning, and his hay-cart. In 1369 the customs of
Linlithgow yielded more than those of any other town in Scotland,
except Edinburgh; and the burgh was taken with Lanark to
supply the place of Berwick and Roxburgh in the court of
the Four Burghs (1368). Robert II. granted it a charter of
immunities in 1384. The palace became a favourite residence
of the kings of Scotland, and often formed part of the marriage
settlement of their consorts (Mary of Guelders, 1449; Margaret
of Denmark, 1468; Margaret of England, 1503). James V.
was born within its walls in 1512, and his daughter Mary on the
7th of December 1542. In 1570 the Regent Moray was assassinated
in the High Street by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh.
The university of Edinburgh took refuge at Linlithgow from
the plague in 1645-1646; in the same year the national parliament,
which had often sat in the palace, was held there for the
last time. In 1661 the Covenant was publicly burned here, and
in 1745 Prince Charles Edward passed through the town. In
1859 the burgh was deprived by the House of Lords of its claim
to levy bridge toll and custom from the railway company.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LINLITHGOWSHIRE,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> or <span class="sc">West Lothian</span>, a south-eastern
county of Scotland, bounded N. by the Firth of Forth, E. and
S.E. by Edinburghshire, S.W. by Lanarkshire and N.W. by
Stirlingshire. It has an area of 76,861 acres, or 120 sq. m.,
and a coast line of 17 m. The surface rises very gradually from
the Firth to the hilly district in the south. A few miles from
the Forth a valley stretches from east to west. Between the
county town and Bathgate are several hills, the chief being
Knock (1017 ft.), Cairnpapple, or Cairnnaple (1000), Cocklerue
(said to be a corruption of Cuckold-le-Roi, 912), Riccarton Hills
(832) terminating eastwards in Binny Craig, a striking eminence
similar to those of Stirling and Edinburgh, Torphichen Hills
(777) and Bowden (749). In the coast district a few bold rocks
are found, such as Dalmeny, Dundas (well wooded and with
a precipitous front), the Binns and a rounded eminence of
559 ft. named Glower-o&rsquo;er-&rsquo;em or Bonnytoun, bearing on its
summit a monument to General Adrian Hope, who fell in the
Indian Mutiny. The river Almond, rising in Lanarkshire and
pursuing a north-easterly direction, enters the Firth at Cramond
after a course of 24 m., during a great part of which it forms
the boundary between West and Mid Lothian. Its right-hand
tributary, Breich Water, constitutes another portion of the
line dividing the same counties. The Avon, rising in the detached
portion of Dumbartonshire, flows eastwards across south Stirlingshire
and then, following in the main a northerly direction,
passes the county town on the west and reaches the Firth about
midway between Grangemouth and Bo&rsquo;ness, having served
as the boundary of Stirlingshire, during rather more than the
latter half of its course. The only loch is Linlithgow Lake (102
acres), immediately adjoining the county town on the north,
a favourite resort of curlers and skaters. It is 10 ft. deep at
the east end and 48 ft. at the west. Eels, perch and braise (a
species of roach) are abundant.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The rocks of Linlithgowshire belong almost without
exception to the Carboniferous system. At the base is the Calciferous
Sandstone series, most of which lies between the Bathgate
Hills and the eastern boundary of the county. In this series are the
Queensferry limestone, the equivalent of the Burdiehouse limestone
of Edinburgh, and the Binny sandstone group with shales and clays
and the Houston coal bed. At more than one horizon in this series
oil shales are found. The Bathgate Hills are formed of basaltic
lavas and tuffs&mdash;an interbedded volcanic group possibly 2000 ft.
thick in the Calciferous Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone
series. A peculiar serpentinous variety of the prevailing rock is
quarried at Blackburn for oven floors; it is known as &ldquo;lakestone.&rdquo;
Binns Hill is the site of one of the volcanic cones of the period.
The Carboniferous Limestone series consists of an upper and lower
limestone group&mdash;including the Petershill, Index, Dykeneuk and
Craigenbuck limestones&mdash;and a middle group of shales, ironstones
and coals; the Smithy, Easter Main, Foul, Red and Splint coals
belong to this horizon. Above the Carboniferous Limestone the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page732" id="page732"></a>732</span>
Millstone grit series crops in a belt which may be traced from the
mouth of the Avon southwards to Whitburn. This is followed by
the true coal-measures with the Boghead or Torbanehill coal, the
Colinburn, Main, Ball, Mill and Upper Cannel or Shotts gas coals
of Armadale, Torbanehill and Fauldhouse.</p>

<p><i>Climate and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The average rainfall for the year is
29.9 in., and the average temperature 47.5° F. (January 38° F.;
July 59.5° F.). More than three-fourths of the county, the agriculture
of which is highly developed, is under cultivation. The best
land is found along the coast, as at Carriden and Dalmeny. The
farming is mostly arable, permanent pasture being practically
stationary (at about 22,000 acres). Oats is the principal grain crop,
but barley and wheat are also cultivated. Farms between 100 and
300 acres are the most common. Turnips and potatoes are the
leading green crops. Much land has been reclaimed; the parish
of Livingston, for example, which in the beginning of the 18th
century was covered with heath and juniper, is now under rotation.
In Torphichen and Bathgate, however, patches of peat moss and
swamp occur, and in the south there are extensive moors at Fauldhouse
and Polkemmet. Live stock does not count for so much in
West Lothian as in other Scottish counties, though a considerable
number of cattle are fattened and dairy farming is followed successfully,
the fresh butter and milk finding a market in Edinburgh.
There is some sheep-farming, and horses and pigs are reared. The
wooded land occurs principally in the parks and &ldquo;policies&rdquo; surrounding
the many noblemen&rsquo;s mansions and private estates.</p>

<p><i>Other Industries.</i>&mdash;The shale-oil trade flourishes at Bathgate,
Broxburn, Armadale, Uphall, Winchburgh, Philpstoun and Dalmeny.
There are important iron-works with blast furnaces at Bo&rsquo;ness,
Kinneil, Whitburn and Bathgate, and coal is also largely mined at
these places. Coal-mining is supposed to have been followed since
Roman times, and the earliest document extant regarding coalpits
in Scotland is a charter granted about the end of the 12th century
to William Oldbridge of Carriden. Fire-clay is extensively worked
in connexion with the coal, and ironstone employs many hands.
Limestone, freestone and whinstone are all quarried. Binny freestone
was used for the Royal Institution and the National Gallery
in Edinburgh, and many important buildings in Glasgow. Some
fishing is carried on from Queensferry, and Bo&rsquo;ness is the principal
port.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The North British Railway Company&rsquo;s line
from Edinburgh to Glasgow runs across the north of the county,
it controls the approaches to the Forth Bridge, and serves the rich
mineral district around Airdrie and Coatbridge in Lanarkshire via
Bathgate. The Caledonian Railway Company&rsquo;s line from Glasgow
to Edinburgh touches the extreme south of the shire. The Union
Canal, constructed in 1818-1822 to connect Edinburgh with the
Forth and Clyde Canal near Camelon in Stirlingshire, crosses the
county, roughly following the N.B.R. line to Falkirk. The Union
Canal, which is 31 m. long and belongs to the North British railway,
is carried across the Almond and Avon on aqueducts designed by
Thomas Telford, and near Falkirk is conveyed through a tunnel
2100 ft. long.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;In 1891 the population
amounted to 52,808, and in 1901 to 65,708, showing an increase
of 24.43% in the decennial period, the highest of any Scottish
county for that decade, and a density of 547 persons to the
sq. m. In 1901 five persons spoke Gaelic only, and 575 Gaelic
and English. The chief towns, with populations in 1901, are
Bathgate (7549), Borrowstounness (9306), Broxburn (7099)
and Linlithgow (4279). The shire returns one member to parliament.
Linlithgowshire is part of the sheriffdom of the Lothians
and Peebles, and a resident sheriff-substitute sits at Linlithgow
and Bathgate. The county is under school-board jurisdiction,
and there are academies at Linlithgow, Bathgate and Bo&rsquo;ness.
The local authorities entrust the bulk of the &ldquo;residue&rdquo; grant
to the County Secondary Education Committee, which subsidizes
elementary technical classes (cookery, laundry and dairy)
and science and art and technological classes, including their
equipment.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Traces of the Pictish inhabitants still exist. Near
Inveravon is an accumulation of shells&mdash;mostly oysters, which
have long ceased to be found so far up the Forth&mdash;considered
by geologists to be a natural bed, but pronounced by antiquaries
to be a kitchen midden. Stone cists have been discovered at
Carlowrie, Dalmeny, Newliston and elsewhere; on Cairnnaple
is a circular structure of remote but unknown date; and at
Kipps is a cromlech that was once surrounded by stones. The
wall of Antoninus lies for several miles in the shire. The
discovery of a fine legionary tablet at Bridgeness in 1868 is
held by some to be conclusive evidence that the great rampart
terminated at that point and not at Carriden. Roman camps
can be distinguished at several spots. On the hill of Bowden
is an earthwork, which J. Stuart Glennie and others connect
with the struggle of the ancient Britons against the Saxons
of Northumbria. The historical associations of the county
mainly cluster round the town of Linlithgow (<i>q.v.</i>). Kingscavil
(pop. 629) disputes with Stonehouse in Lanarkshire the honour
of being the birthplace of Patrick Hamilton, the martyr (1504-1528).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINNAEUS,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> the name usually given to <span class="sc">Carl von Linné</span>
(1707-1778), Swedish botanist, who was born on the 13th of
May, O.S. (May 23, N.S.) 1707 at Råshult, in the province
of Småland, Sweden, and was the eldest child of Nils Linnaeus
the comminister, afterwards pastor, of the parish, and Christina
Brodersonia, the daughter of the previous incumbent. In
1717 he was sent to the primary school at Wexiö, and in 1724
he passed to the gymnasium. His interests were centred on
botany, and his progress in the studies considered necessary
for admission to holy orders, for which he was intended, was
so slight that in 1726 his father was recommended to apprentice
him to a tailor or shoemaker. He was saved from this fate
through Dr Rothman, a physician in the town, who expressed
the belief that he would yet distinguish himself in medicine
and natural history, and who further instructed him in physiology.
In 1727 he entered the university of Lund, but removed
in the following year to that of Upsala. There, through lack
of means, he had a hard struggle until, in 1729, he made the
acquaintance of Dr Olaf Celsius (1670-1756), professor of
theology, at that time working at his <i>Hierobotanicon</i>, which
saw the light nearly twenty years later. Celsius, impressed
with Linnaeus&rsquo;s knowledge and botanical collections, and
finding him necessitous, offered him board and lodging.</p>

<p>During this period, he came upon a critique which ultimately
led to the establishment of his artificial system of plant classification.
This was a review of Sébastien Vaillant&rsquo;s <i>Sermo de
Structura Florum</i> (Leiden, 1718), a thin quarto in French and
Latin; it set him upon examining the stamens and pistils of
flowers, and, becoming convinced of the paramount importance
of these organs, he formed the idea of basing a system of arrangement
upon them. Another work by Wallin, <span class="grk" title="Gamos phytôn">&#915;&#940;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>, <i>sive
Nuptiae Arborum Dissertatio</i> (Upsala, 1729), having fallen into
his hands, he drew up a short treatise on the sexes of plants,
which was placed in the hands of the younger Olaf Rudbeck
(1660-1740), the professor of botany in the university. In
the following year Rudbeck, whose advanced age compelled
him to lecture by deputy, appointed Linnaeus his adjunctus;
in the spring of 1730, therefore, the latter began his lectures.
The academic garden was entirely remodelled under his auspices,
and furnished with many rare species. In the preceding
year he had solicited appointment to the vacant post of gardener,
which was refused him on the ground of his capacity for better
things.</p>

<p>In 1732 he undertook to explore Lapland, at the cost of the
Academy of Sciences of Upsala; he traversed upwards of
4600 m., and the cost of the journey is given at 530 copper dollars,
or about £25 sterling. His own account was published in
English by Sir J. E. Smith, under the title <i>Lachesis Lapponica</i>,
in 1811; the scientific results were published in his <i>Flora
Lapponica</i> (Amsterdam, 1737). In 1733 Linnaeus was engaged
at Upsala in teaching the methods of assaying ores, but was
prevented from delivering lectures on botany for academic
reasons. At this juncture the governor of Dalecarlia invited
him to travel through his province, as he had done through
Lapland. Whilst on this journey, he lectured at Fahlun to
large audiences; and J. Browallius (1707-1755), the chaplain
there, afterwards bishop of Åbo, strongly urged him to go abroad
and take his degree of M.D. at a foreign university, by which
means he could afterwards settle where he pleased. Accordingly
he left Sweden in 1735. Travelling by Lübeck and Hamburg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page733" id="page733"></a>733</span>
he proceeded to Harderwijk, where he went through the requisite
examinations, and defended his thesis on the cause of intermittent
fever. His scanty funds were now nearly spent, but he passed
on through Haarlem to Leiden; there he called on Jan Fredrik
Gronovius (1600-1762), who, returning the visit, was shown
the <i>Systema naturae</i> in MS., and was so greatly astonished at
it that he sent it to press at his own expense. This famous
system, which, artificial as it was, substituted order for confusion,
largely made its way on account of the lucid and admirable laws,
and comments on them, which were issued almost at the same
time (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Botany</a></span>). H. Boerhaave, whom Linnaeus saw after
waiting eight days for admission, recommended him to J. Burman
(1707-1780), the professor of botany at Amsterdam, with whom
he stayed a twelvemonth. While there he issued his <i>Fundamenta
Botanica</i>, an unassuming small octavo, which exercised immense
influence. For some time also he lived with the wealthy banker,
G. Clifford (1685-1750), who had a magnificent garden at
Hartecamp, near Haarlem.</p>

<p>In 1736 Linnaeus visited England. He was warmly recommended
by Boerhaave to Sir Hans Sloane, who seems to have
received him coldly. At Oxford Dr Thomas Shaw welcomed
him cordially; J. J. Dillenius, the professor of botany, was
cold at first, but afterwards changed completely, kept him
a month, and even offered to share the emoluments of the chair
with him. He saw Philip Miller (1691-1771), the <i>Hortulanorum
Princeps</i>, at Chelsea Physic Garden, and took some plants
thence to Clifford; but certain other stories which are current
about his visit to England are of very doubtful authenticity.</p>

<p>On his return to the Netherlands he completed the printing
of his <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, a volume which must be considered
the starting-point of modern systematic botany. During the
same year, 1737, he finished arranging Clifford&rsquo;s collection
of plants, living and dried, described in the <i>Hortus Cliffortianus</i>.
During the compilation he used to &ldquo;amuse&rdquo; himself with
drawing up the <i>Critica Botanica</i>, also printed in the Netherlands.
But this strenuous and unremitting labour told upon him; the
atmosphere of the Low Countries seemed to oppress him beyond
endurance; and, resisting all Clifford&rsquo;s entreaties to remain
with him, he started homewards, yet on the way he remained
a year at Leiden, and published his <i>Classes Plantarum</i> (1738).
He then visited Paris, where he saw Antoine and Bernard de
Jussieu, and finally sailed for Sweden from Rouen. In September
1738 he established himself as a physician in Stockholm, but,
being unknown as a medical man, no one at first cared to consult
him; by degrees, however, he found patients, was appointed
naval physician at Stockholm, with minor appointments, and in
June 1730 married Sara Moræa. In 1741 he was appointed to
the chair of medicine at Upsala, but soon exchanged it for that of
botany. In the same year, previous to this exchange, he travelled
through Öland and Gothland, by command of the state, publishing
his results in <i>Oländska och Gothländska Resa</i> (1745). The
index to this volume shows the first employment of specific
names in nomenclature.</p>

<p>Henceforward his time was taken up by teaching and the
preparation of other works. In 1745 he issued his <i>Flora Suecica</i>
and <i>Fauna Suecica</i>, the latter having occupied his attention
during fifteen years; afterwards, two volumes of observations
made during journeys in Sweden, <i>Wästgöta Resa</i> (Stockholm,
1747), and <i>Skånska Resa</i> (Stockholm, 1751). In 1748 he brought
out his <i>Hortus Upsaliensis</i>, showing that he had added eleven
hundred species to those formerly in cultivation in that garden.
In 1750 his <i>Philosophia Botanica</i> was given to the world; it
consists of a commentary on the various axioms he had published
in 1735 in his <i>Fundamenta Botanica</i>, and was dictated to his
pupil P. Löfling (1720-1756), while the professor was confined
to his bed by an attack of gout. But the most important work
of this period was his <i>Species Plantarum</i> (Stockholm, 1753), in
which the specific names are fully set forth. In the same year
he was created knight of the Polar Star, the first time a scientific
man had been raised to that honour in Sweden. In 1755 he
was invited by the king of Spain to settle in that country, with
a liberal salary, and full liberty of conscience, but he declined
on the ground that whatever merits he possessed should be
devoted to his country&rsquo;s service, and Löfling was sent instead.
He was enabled now to purchase the estates of Säfja and
Hammarby; at the latter he built his museum of stone, to
guard against loss by fire. His lectures at the university drew
men from all parts of the world; the normal number of students
at Upsala was five hundred, but while he occupied the chair
of botany there it rose to fifteen hundred. In 1761 he was
granted a patent of nobility, antedated to 1757, from which
time he was styled Carl von Linné. To his great delight the
tea-plant was introduced alive into Europe in 1763; in the
same year his surviving son Carl (1741-1783) was allowed to assist
his father in his professorial duties, and to be trained as his
successor. At the age of sixty his memory began to fail; an
apoplectic attack in 1774 greatly weakened him; two years
after he lost the use of his right side; and he died on the 10th
of January 1778 at Upsala, in the cathedral of which he was
buried.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With Linnaeus arrangement seems to have been a passion; he
delighted in devising classifications, and not only did he systematize
the three kingdoms of nature, but even drew up a treatise on the
<i>Genera Morborum</i>. When he appeared upon the scene, new plants
and animals were in course of daily discovery in increasing numbers,
due to the increase of trading facilities; he devised schemes of
arrangement by which these acquisitions might be sorted provisionally,
until their natural affinities should have become clearer.
He made many mistakes; but the honour due to him for having first
enunciated the principles for defining genera and species, and his
uniform use of specific names, is enduring. His style is terse and
laconic; he methodically treated of each organ in its proper turn,
and had a special term for each, the meaning of which did not vary.
The reader cannot doubt the author&rsquo;s intention; his sentences are
business-like and to the point. The omission of the verb in his
descriptions was an innovation, and gave an abruptness to his
language which was foreign to the writing of his time; but it
probably by its succinctness added to the popularity of his works.</p>

<p>No modern naturalist has impressed his own character with greater
force upon his pupils than did Linnaeus. He imbued them with
his own intense acquisitiveness, reared them in an atmosphere of
enthusiasm, trained them to close and accurate observation, and
then despatched them to various parts of the globe.</p>

<p>His published works amount to more than one hundred and
eighty, including the <i>Amoenitates Academicae</i>, for which he provided
the material, revising them also for press; corrections in his handwriting
may be seen in the Banksian and Linnean Society&rsquo;s libraries.
Many of his works were not published during his lifetime; those
which were are enumerated by Dr Richard Pulteney in his <i>General
View of the Writings of Linnaeus</i> (1781). His widow sold his collections
and books to Sir J. E. Smith, the first president of the Linnean
Society of London. When Smith died in 1828, a subscription was
raised to purchase the herbarium and library for the Society, whose
property they became. The manuscripts of many of Linnaeus&rsquo;s
publications, and the letters he received from his contemporaries,
also came into the possession of the Society.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINNELL, JOHN<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1792-1882), English painter, was born in
London on the 16th of June 1792. His father being a carver and
gilder, Linnell was early brought into contact with artists,
and when he was ten years old he was drawing and selling his
portraits in chalk and pencil. His first artistic instruction was
received from Benjamin West, and he spent a year in the house
of John Varley the water-colour painter, where he had William
Hunt and Mulready as fellow-pupils, and made the acquaintance
of Shelley, Godwin and other men of mark. In 1805 he was
admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained
medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was also
trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Burial of Saul.&rdquo; In after life he frequently occupied himself
with the burin, publishing, in 1834, a series of outlines from
Michelangelo&rsquo;s frescoes in the Sistine chapel, and, in 1840,
superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures
in Buckingham Palace, one of them, a Titian landscape, being
mezzotinted by himself. At first he supported himself mainly by
miniature painting, and by the execution of larger portraits,
such as the likenesses of Mulready, Whately, Peel and Carlyle.
Several of his portraits he engraved with his own hand in line
and mezzotint. He also painted many subjects like the &ldquo;St John
Preaching,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Covenant of Abraham,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Journey
to Emmaus,&rdquo; in which, while the landscape is usually prominent
the figures are yet of sufficient importance to supply the title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page734" id="page734"></a>734</span>
of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with his paintings
of pure landscape that his name is known. His works commonly
deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape,
which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset.
They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing
in colour. Linnell was able to command very large prices for
his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill,
Surrey, where he resided till his death on the 20th of January
1882, painting with unabated power till within the last few years
of his life. His leisure was greatly occupied with a study of
the Scriptures in the original, and he published several pamphlets
and larger treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of
the best friends and kindest patrons of William Blake. He
gave him the two largest commissions he ever received for
single series of designs&mdash;£150 for drawings and engravings
of <i>The Inventions to the Book of Job</i>, and a like sum for those
illustrative of Dante.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINNET,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> O. Eng. <i>Linete</i> and <i>Linet-wige</i>, whence seems to have
been corrupted the old Scottish &ldquo;Lintquhit,&rdquo; and the modern
northern English &ldquo;Lintwhite&rdquo;&mdash;originally a somewhat generalized
bird&rsquo;s name, but latterly specialized for the <i>Fringilla cannabina</i>
of Linnaeus, the <i>Linota cannabina</i> of recent ornithologists.
This is a common song-bird, frequenting almost the whole of
Europe south of lat. 64°, and in Asia extending to Turkestan.
It is known as a winter visitant to Egypt and Abyssinia, and
is abundant at all seasons in Barbary, as well as in the Canaries
and Madeira. Though the fondness of this species for the seeds
of flax (<i>Linum</i>) and hemp (<i>Cannabis</i>) has given it its common
name in so many European languages,<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> it feeds largely, if not
chiefly in Britain on the seeds of plants of the order <i>Compositae</i>,
especially those growing on heaths and commons. As these
waste places have been gradually brought under the plough,
in England and Scotland particularly, the haunts and means
of subsistence of the linnet have been curtailed, and hence
its numbers have undergone a very visible diminution throughout
Great Britain. According to its sex, or the season of the year,
it is known as the red, grey or brown linnet, and by the earlier
English writers on birds, as well as in many localities at the
present time, these names have been held to distinguish at
least two species; but there is now no question among
ornithologists on this point, though the conditions under which
the bright crimson-red colouring of the breast and crown of
the cock&rsquo;s spring and summer plumage is donned and doffed
may still be open to discussion. Its intensity seems due,
however, in some degree at least, to the weathering of the brown
fringes of the feathers which hide the more brilliant hue, and
in the Atlantic islands examples are said to retain their gay
tints all the year round, while throughout Europe there is
scarcely a trace of them visible in autumn and winter; but,
beginning to appear in spring, they reach their greatest brilliancy
towards midsummer; they are never assumed by examples
in confinement. The linnet begins to breed in April, the nest
being generally placed in a bush at no great distance from the
ground. It is nearly always a neat structure composed of
fine twigs, roots or bents, and lined with wool or hair. The
eggs, often six in number, are of a very pale blue marked with
reddish or purplish brown. Two broods seem to be common
in the course of the season, and towards the end of summer the
birds&mdash;the young greatly preponderating in number&mdash;collect
in large flocks and move to the sea-coast, whence a large proportion
depart for more southern latitudes. Of these emigrants
some return the following spring, and are recognizable by the
more advanced state of their plumage, the effect presumably
of having wintered in countries enjoying a brighter and hotter
sun.</p>

<p>Nearly allied to the foregoing species is the twite, so named
from its ordinary call-note, or mountain-linnet, the <i>Linota
flavirostris</i>, or <i>L. montium</i> of ornithologists, which can be distinguished
by its yellow bill, longer tail and reddish-tawny
throat. This bird never assumes any crimson on the crown or
breast, but the male has the rump at all times tinged more or
less with that colour. In Great Britain in the breeding-season
it seems to affect exclusively hilly and moorland districts from
Herefordshire northward, in which it partly or wholly replaces
the common linnet, but is very much more local in its distribution,
and, except in the British Islands and some parts of Scandinavia,
it only appears as an irregular visitant in winter. At
that season it may, however, be found in large flocks in the
low-lying countries, and as regards England even on the sea-shore.
In Asia it seems to be represented by a kindred form
<i>L. brevirostris</i>.</p>

<p>The redpolls form a little group placed by many authorities
in the genus <i>Linota</i>, to which they are unquestionably closely
allied, and, as stated elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Finch</a></span>), the linnets seem
to be related to the birds of the genus <i>Leucosticte</i>, the species
of which inhabit the northern parts of North-West America
and of Asia. <i>L. tephrocotis</i> is generally of a chocolate colour,
tinged on some parts with pale crimson or pink, and has the
crown of the head silvery-grey. Another species, <i>L. arctoa</i>,
was formerly said to have occurred in North America, but its
proper home is in the Kurile Islands or Kamchatka. This has
no red in its plumage. The birds of the genus <i>Leucosticte</i> seem
to be more terrestrial in their habit than those of <i>Linota</i>, perhaps
from their having been chiefly observed where trees are scarce;
but it is possible that the mutual relationship of the two groups
is more apparent than real. Allied to <i>Leucosticte</i> is <i>Montifringilla</i>,
to which belongs the snow-finch of the Alps, <i>M. nivalis</i>,
often mistaken by travellers for the snow-bunting, <i>Plectrophanes
nivalis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINSANG,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> the native name of one of the members of the
viverrine genus <i>Linsanga</i>. There are four species of the genus,
from the Indo-Malay countries. Linsangs are civet-like
creatures, with the body and tail greatly elongated; and the
ground colour fulvous marked with bold black patches, which
in one species (<i>L. pardicolor</i>) are oblong. In West Africa the
group is represented by the smaller and spotted <i>Poiana richardsoni</i>

<p><span class="bold">LINSEED,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> the seed of the common flax (<i>q.v.</i>) or lint, <i>Linum
usitatissimum</i>. These seeds, the linseed of commerce, are of
a lustrous brown colour externally, and a compressed and
elongated oval form, with a slight beak or projection at one
extremity. The brown testa contains, in the outer of the four
coats into which it is microscopically distinguishable, an abundant
secretion of mucilaginous matter; and it has within it a thin
layer of albumen, enclosing a pair of large oily cotyledons.
The seeds when placed in water for some time become coated
with glutinous matter from the exudation of the mucilage in
the external layer of the epidermis; and by boiling in sixteen
parts of water they exude sufficient mucilage to form with the
water a thick pasty decoction. The cotyledons contain the
valuable linseed oil referred to below. Linseed grown in tropical
countries is much larger and more plump than that obtained
in temperate climes, but the seed from the colder countries
yields a finer quality of oil.</p>

<p>Linseed formed an article of food among the Greeks and
Romans, and it is said that the Abyssinians at the present day
eat it roasted. The oil is to some extent used as food in Russia
and in parts of Poland and Hungary. The still prevalent use of
linseed in poultices for open wounds is entirely to be reprobated.
It has now been abandoned by practitioners. The principal
objections to this use of linseed is that it specially favours the
growth of micro-organisms. There are numerous clean and
efficient substitutes which have all its supposed advantages
and none of its disadvantages. There are now no medicinal
uses of this substance. Linseed cake, the marc left after the
expression of the oil, is a most valuable feeding substance for
cattle.</p>

<p>Linseed is subject to extensive and detrimental adulterations,
resulting not only from careless harvesting and cleaning, whereby
seeds of the flax dodder, and other weeds and grasses are mixed
with it, but also from the direct admixture of cheaper and inferior
oil-seeds, such as wild rape, mustard, sesame, poppy, &amp;c., the
latter adulterations being known in trade under the generic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page735" id="page735"></a>735</span>
name of &ldquo;buffum.&rdquo; In 1864, owing to the serious aspect of
the prevalent adulteration, a union of traders was formed
under the name of the &ldquo;Linseed Association.&rdquo; This body
samples all linseed oil arriving in England and reports on
its value.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Linseed oil</i>, the most valuable drying oil, is obtained by expression
from the seeds, with or without the aid of heat. Preliminary to the
operation of pressing, the seeds are crushed and ground to a fine
meal. Cold pressing of the seeds yields a golden-yellow oil, which
is often used as an edible oil. Larger quantities are obtained by
heating the crushed seeds to 160° F. (71° C.), and then expressing
the oil. So obtained, it is somewhat turbid and yellowish-brown in
colour. On storing, moisture and mucilaginous matter gradually
settle out. After storing several years it is known commercially as
&ldquo;tanked oil,&rdquo; and has a high value in varnish-making. The delay
attendant on this method of purification is avoided by treating the
crude oil with 1 to 2% of a somewhat strong sulphuric acid, which
chars and carries down the bulk of the impurities. For the preparation
of &ldquo;artist&rsquo;s oil,&rdquo; the finest form of linseed oil, the refined oil is
placed in shallow trays covered with glass, and exposed to the
action of the sun&rsquo;s rays. Numerous other methods of purification,
some based on the oxidizing action of ozone, have been suggested.
The yield of oil from different classes of seed varies, but from 23 to
28% of the weight of the seed operated on should be obtained. A
good average quality of seed weighing about 392 &#8468; per quarter has
been found in practice to give out 109 &#8468; of oil.</p>

<p>Commercial linseed oil has a peculiar, rather disagreeable sharp
taste and smell; its specific gravity is given as varying from 0.928
to 0.953, and it solidifies at about -27°. By saponification it yields
a number of fatty acids&mdash;palmitic, myristic, oleic, linolic, linolenic
and isolinolenic. Exposed to the air in thin films, linseed oil absorbs
oxygen and forms &ldquo;linoxyn,&rdquo; a resinous semi-elastic, caoutchouc-like
mass, of uncertain composition. The oil, when boiled with
small proportions of litharge and minium, undergoes the process of
resinification in the air with greatly increased rapidity.</p>

<p>Its most important use is in the preparation of oil paints and
varnishes. By painters both raw and boiled oil are used, the latter
forming the principal medium in oil painting, and also serving
separately as the basis of all oil varnishes. Boiled oil is prepared in
a variety of ways&mdash;that most common being by heating the raw oil
in an iron or copper boiler, which, to allow for frothing, must only
be about three-fourths filled. The boiler is heated by a furnace,
and the oil is brought gradually to the point of ebullition, at which
it is maintained for two hours, during which time moisture is driven
off, and the scum and froth which accumulate on the surface are
ladled out. Then by slow degrees a proportion of &ldquo;dryers&rdquo; is
added&mdash;usually equal weights of litharge and minium being used to
the extent of 3% of the charge of oil; and with these a small
proportion of umber is generally thrown in. After the addition of
the dryers the boiling is continued two or three hours; the fire is
then suddenly withdrawn, and the oil is left covered up in the boiler
for ten hours or more. Before sending out, it is usually stored in
settling tanks for a few weeks, during which time the uncombined
dryers settle at the bottom as &ldquo;foots.&rdquo; Besides the dryers already
mentioned, lead acetate, manganese borate, manganese dioxide,
zinc sulphate and other bodies are used.</p>

<p>Linseed oil is also the principal ingredient in printing and lithographic
inks. The oil for ink-making is prepared by heating it in
an iron pot up to the point where it either takes fire spontaneously
or can be ignited with any flaming substance. After the oil has
been allowed to burn for some time according to the consistence
of the varnish desired, the pot is covered over, and the product
when cooled forms a viscid tenacious substance which in its most
concentrated form may be drawn into threads. By boiling
this varnish with dilute nitric acid vapours of acrolein are given
off, and the substance gradually becomes a solid non-adhesive
mass the same as the ultimate oxidation product of both raw and
boiled oil.</p>

<p>Linseed oil is subject to various falsifications, chiefly through the
addition of cotton-seed, niger-seed and hemp-seed oils; and rosin
oil and mineral oils also are not infrequently added. Except by
smell, by change of specific gravity, and by deterioration of drying
properties, these adulterations are difficult to detect.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINTH,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Limmat</span>, a river of Switzerland, one of the
tributaries of the Aar. It rises in the glaciers of the Tödi range,
and has cut out a deep bed which forms the Grossthal that
comprises the greater portion of the canton of Glarus. A little
below the town of Glarus the river, keeping its northerly direction,
runs through the alluvial plain which it has formed, towards the
Walensee and the Lake of Zürich. But between the Lake of Zürich
and the Walensee the huge desolate alluvial plain grew ever in
size, while great damage was done by the river, which overflowed
its bed and the dykes built to protect the region near it.
The Swiss diet decided in 1804 to undertake the &ldquo;correction&rdquo;
of this turbulent stream. The necessary works were begun in
1807 under the supervision of Hans Conrad Escher of Zürich
(1767-1823). The first portion of the undertaking was completed
in 1811, and received the name of the &ldquo;Escher canal,&rdquo; the river
being thus diverted into the Walensee. The second portion,
known as the &ldquo;Linth canal,&rdquo; regulated the course of the river
between the Walensee and the Lake of Zürich and was completed
in 1816. Many improvements and extra protective works were
carried out after 1816, and it was estimated that the total cost
of this great engineering undertaking from 1807 to 1902 amounted
to about £200,000, the date for the completion of the work being
1911. To commemorate the efforts of Escher, the Swiss diet in
1823 (after his death) decided that his male descendants should
bear the name of &ldquo;Escher von der Linth.&rdquo; On issuing from the
Lake of Zürich the Linth alters its name to that of &ldquo;Limmat,&rdquo;
it does not appear wherefore, and, keeping the north-westerly
direction it had taken from the Walensee, joins the Aar a little
way below Brugg, and just below the junction of the Reuss
with the Aar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINTON, ELIZA LYNN<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1822-1898), English novelist, daughter
of the Rev. J. Lynn, vicar of Crosthwaite, in Cumberland, was
born at Keswick on the 10th of February 1822. She early
manifested great independence of character, and in great measure
educated herself from the stores of her father&rsquo;s library. Coming
to London about 1845 with a large stock of miscellaneous erudition,
she turned this to account in her first novels, <i>Azeth the
Egyptian</i> (1846) and <i>Amymone</i> (1848), a romance of the days of
Pericles. Her next story, <i>Realities</i>, a tale of modern life (1851),
was not successful, and for several years she seemed to have
abandoned fiction. When, in 1865, she reappeared with <i>Grasp
your Nettle</i>, it was as an expert in a new style of novel-writing&mdash;stirring,
fluent, ably-constructed stories, retaining the attention
throughout, but affording little to reflect upon or to remember.
Measured by their immediate success, they gave her an honourable
position among the writers of her day, and secure of an
audience, she continued to write with vigour nearly until her
death. <i>Lizzie Lorton of Greyrigg</i> (1866), <i>Patricia Kemball</i> (1874),
<i>The Atonement of Leam Dundas</i> (1877) are among the best
examples of this more mechanical side of her talent, to which
there were notable exceptions in <i>Joshua Davidson</i> (1872), a bold
but not irreverent adaptation of the story of the Carpenter
of Nazareth to that of the French Commune; and <i>Christopher
Kirkland</i>, a veiled autobiography (1885). Mrs Linton was a
practised and constant writer in the journals of the day; her
articles on the &ldquo;Girl of the Period&rdquo; in the <i>Saturday Review</i>
produced a great sensation, and she was a constant contributor
to the <i>St James&rsquo;s Gazette</i>, the <i>Daily News</i> and other leading newspapers.
Many of her detached essays have been collected. In
1858 she married W. J. Linton, the engraver, but the union was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page736" id="page736"></a>736</span>
soon terminated by mutual consent; she nevertheless brought
up one of Mr Linton&rsquo;s daughters by a former marriage. A
few years before her death she retired to Malvern. She died in
London on the 14th of July 1898.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINTON, WILLIAM JAMES<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1812-1897), English wood-engraver,
republican and author, was born in London. He was
educated at Stratford, and in his sixteenth year was apprenticed
to the wood-engraver G. W. Bonner. His earliest known work
is to be found in Martin and Westall&rsquo;s <i>Pictorial Illustrations of the
Bible</i> (1833). He rapidly rose to a place amongst the foremost
wood-engravers of the time. After working as a journeyman
engraver with two or three firms, losing his money over a cheap
political library called the &ldquo;National,&rdquo; and writing a life of
Thomas Paine, he went into partnership (1842) with John Orrin
Smith. The firm was immediately employed on the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>, just then projected. The following year Orrin
Smith died, and Linton, who had married a sister of Thomas
Wade, editor of <i>Bell&rsquo;s Weekly Messenger</i>, found himself in sole
charge of a business upon which two families were dependent.
For years he had concerned himself with the social and European
political problems of the time, and was now actively engaged in
the republican propaganda. In 1844 he took a prominent part
in exposing the violation by the English post-office of Mazzini&rsquo;s
correspondence. This led to a friendship with the Italian
revolutionist, and Linton threw himself with ardour into European
politics. He carried the first congratulatory address of English
workmen to the French Provisional Government in 1848. He
edited a twopenny weekly paper, <i>The Cause of the People</i>, published
in the Isle of Man, and he wrote political verses for the
Dublin <i>Nation</i>, signed &ldquo;Spartacus.&rdquo; He helped to found the
&ldquo;International League&rdquo; of patriots, and, in 1850, with G. H.
Lewes and Thornton Hunt, started <i>The Leader</i>, an organ which,
however, did not satisfy his advanced republicanism, and from
which he soon withdrew. The same year he wrote a series of
articles propounding the views of Mazzini in <i>The Red Republican</i>.
In 1852 he took up his residence at Brantwood, which he afterwards
sold to John Ruskin, and from there issued <i>The English
Republic</i>, first in the form of weekly tracts and afterwards as a
monthly magazine&mdash;&ldquo;a useful exponent of republican principles,
a faithful record of republican progress throughout the world;
an organ of propagandism and a medium of communication for
the active republicans in England.&rdquo; Most of the paper, which
never paid its way and was abandoned in 1855, was written by
himself. In 1852 he also printed for private circulation an
anonymous volume of poems entitled <i>The Plaint of Freedom</i>.
After the failure of his paper he returned to his proper work of
wood-engraving. In 1857 his wife died, and in the following year
he married Eliza Lynn (afterwards known as Mrs Lynn Linton)
and returned to London. In 1864 he retired to Brantwood, his
wife remaining in London. In 1867, pressed by financial difficulties,
he determined to try his fortune in America, and finally
separated from his wife, with whom, however, he always corresponded
affectionately. With his children he settled at Appledore,
New Haven, Connecticut, where he set up a printing-press. Here
he wrote <i>Practical Hints on Wood-Engraving</i> (1879), <i>James
Watson, a Memoir of Chartist Times</i> (1879), <i>A History of Wood-Engraving
in America</i> (1882), <i>Wood-Engraving, a Manual of
Instruction</i> (1884), <i>The Masters of Wood-Engraving</i>, for which
he made two journeys to England (1890), <i>The Life of Whittier</i>
(1893), and <i>Memories</i>, an autobiography (1895). He died at
New Haven on the 29th of December 1897. Linton was a singularly
gifted man, who, in the words of his wife, if he had not
bitten the Dead Sea apple of impracticable politics, would have
risen higher in the world of both art and letters. As an engraver
on wood he reached the highest point of execution in his own line.
He carried on the tradition of Bewick, fought for intelligent as
against merely manipulative excellence in the use of the graver,
and championed the use of the &ldquo;white line&rdquo; as well as of the
black, believing with Ruskin that the former was the truer and
more telling basis of aesthetic expression in the wood-block
printed upon paper.</p>

21. According to the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, Linus suffered martyrdom,
and was buried in the Vatican. In the 17th century an
inscription was found near the confession of St Peter, which was
believed to contain the name Linus; but it is not certain that
this epitaph has been read correctly or completely. The
apocryphal Latin account of the death of the apostles Peter and
Paul is falsely attributed to Linus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LINUS,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> one of a numerous class of heroic figures in Greek
legend, of which other examples are found in Hyacinthus and
Adonis. The connected legend is always of the same character:
a beautiful youth, fond of hunting and rural life, the favourite
of some god or goddess, suddenly perishes by a terrible death.
In many cases the religious background of the legend is preserved
by the annual ceremonial that commemorated it. At Argos
this religious character of the Linus myth was best preserved:
the secret child of Psamathe by the god Apollo, Linus is exposed,
nursed by sheep and torn in pieces by sheep-dogs. Every year
at the festival Arnis or Cynophontis, the women of Argos mourned
for Linus and propitiated Apollo, who in revenge for his child&rsquo;s
death had sent a female monster (Poin&#275;), which tore the children
from their mothers&rsquo; arms. Lambs were sacrificed, all dogs found
running loose were killed, and women and children raised a
lament for Linus and Psamathe (Pausanias i. 43. 7; Conon,
<i>Narrat.</i> 19). In the Theban version, Linus, the son of Amphimarus
and the muse Urania, was a famous musician, inventor
of the Linus song, who was said to have been slain by Apollo,
because he had challenged him to a contest (Pausanias ix.
29. 6). A later story makes him the teacher of Heracles, by whom
he was killed because he had rebuked his pupil for stupidity
(Apollodorus ii. 4. 9). On Mount Helicon there was a grotto
containing his statue, to which sacrifice was offered every year
before the sacrifices to the Muses. From being the inventor of
musical methods, he was finally transformed by later writers
into a composer of prophecies and legends. He was also said to
have adapted the Phoenician letters introduced by Cadmus to
the Greek language. It is generally agreed that Linus and
Ailinus are of Semitic origin, derived from the words <i>ai lanu</i>
(woe to us), which formed the burden of the Adonis and similar
songs popular in the East. The Linus song is mentioned in
Homer; the tragedians often use the word <span class="grk" title="ailinos">&#945;&#7988;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> as the refrain
in mournful songs, and Euripides calls the custom a Phrygian
one. Linus, originally the personification of the song of lamentation,
becomes, like Adonis, Maneros, Narcissus, the representative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page737" id="page737"></a>737</span>
of the tender life of nature and of the vegetation destroyed by
the fiery heat of the dog-star.</p>

Mythologie</i>; J. G. Frazer, <i>Golden Bough</i> (ii. 224, 253), where,
the identity of Linus with Adonis (possibly a corn-spirit) being
assumed, the lament is explained as the lamentation of the reapers
over the dead corn-spirit; W. Mannhardt, <i>Wald- und Feldculte</i>,

Austria, and see of a bishop, 117 m. W. of Vienna by rail. Pop.
(1900) 58,778. It lies on the right bank of the Danube and is
connected by an iron bridge, 308 yds. long, with the market-town
of Urfahr (pop. 12,827) on the opposite bank. Linz
possesses two cathedrals, one built in 1669-1682 in rococo style,
and another in early Gothic style, begun in 1862. In the Capuchin
church is the tomb of Count Raimondo Montecucculi, who died
at Linz in 1680. The museum Francisco-Carolinum, founded
in 1833 and reconstructed in 1895, contains several important
collections relating to the history of Upper Austria. In the
Franz Josef-Platz stands a marble monument, known as Trinity
Column, erected by the emperor Charles VI. in 1723, commemorating
the triple deliverance of Linz from war, fire, and
pestilence. The principal manufactories are of tobacco, boat-building,
agricultural implements, foundries and cloth factories.
Being an important railway junction and a port of the Danube,
Linz has a very active transit trade.</p>

<p>Linz is believed to stand on the site of the Roman station
<i>Lentia</i>. The name of Linz appears in documents for the first
time in 799 and it received municipal rights in 1324. In 1490
it became the capital of the province above the Enns. It successfully
resisted the attacks of the insurgent peasants under Stephen
Fadinger on the 21st and 22nd of July 1626, but its suburbs
were laid in ashes. During the siege of Vienna in 1683, the castle
of Linz was the residence of Leopold I. In 1741, during the
War of the Austrian Succession, Linz was taken by the Bavarians,
but was recovered by the Austrians in the following year. The
bishopric was established in 1784.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LION<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (Lat. <i>leo</i>, <i>leonis</i>; Gr. <span class="grk" title="leôn">&#955;&#941;&#969;&#957;</span>). From the earliest historic
times few animals have been better known to man than the lion.
Its habitat made it familiar to all the races among whom human
civilization took its origin. The literature of the ancient Hebrews
abounds in allusions to the lion; and the almost incredible
numbers stated to have been provided for exhibition and destruction
in the Roman amphitheatres (as many as six hundred on
a single occasion by Pompey, for example) show how abundant
these animals must have been within accessible distance of Rome.</p>

<p>Even within the historic period the geographical range of the
lion covered the whole of Africa, the south of Asia, including
Syria, Arabia, Asia Minor, Persia and the greater part of northern
and central India. Professor A. B. Meyer, director of the
zoological museum at Dresden, has published an article on the
alleged existence of the lion in historical times in Greece, a
translation of which appears in the <i>Report</i> of the Smithsonian
Institution for 1905. Meyer is of opinion that the writer of the
<i>Iliad</i> was probably acquainted with the lion, but this does not
prove its former existence in Greece. The accounts given by
Herodotus and Aristotle merely go to show that about 500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
lions existed in some part of eastern Europe. The Greek name
for the lion is very ancient, and this suggests, although by no
means demonstrates, that it refers to an animal indigenous to
the country. Although the evidence is not decisive, it seems
probable that lions did exist in Greece at the time of Herodotus;
and it is quite possible that the representation of a lion-chase
incised on a Mycenean dagger may have been taken from life.
In prehistoric times the lion was spread over the greater part
of Europe; and if, as is very probable, the so-called <i>Felis
atrox</i> be inseparable, its range also included the greater part of
North America.</p>

<p>At the present day the lion is found throughout Africa (save
in places where it has been exterminated by man) and in Mesopotamia,
Persia, and some parts of north-west India. According
to Dr W. T. Blanford, lions are still numerous in the reedy
swamps, bordering the Tigris and Euphrates, and also occur on
the west flanks of the Zagros mountains and the oak-clad ranges
near Shiraz, to which they are attracted by the herds of swine
which feed on the acorns. The lion nowhere exists in the table-land
of Persia, nor is it found in Bal&#363;chist&#257;n. In India it is
confined to the province of Kathiawar in Gujerat, though
within the 19th century it extended through the north-west
parts of Hindustan, from Bah&#257;walpur and Sind to at least the
Jumna (about Delhi) southward as far as Kh&#257;ndesh, and in central
India through the Sagur and Narbuda territories, Bundelkund,
and as far east as Palamau. It was extirpated in Hari&#257;na
about 1824. One was killed at Rhyli, in the Dumaoh district,
Sagur and Narbuda territories, so late as in the cold season
of 1847-1848; and about the same time a few still remained
in the valley of the Sind river in Kotah, central India.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Lion and Lioness (<i>Felis leo</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>The variations in external characters which lions present,
especially in the colour and the amount of mane, as well as in
the general colour of the fur, indicate local races, to which
special names have been given; the Indian lion being <i>F. leo
gujratensis</i>. It is noteworthy, however, that, according to Mr
F. C. Selous, in South Africa the black-maned lion and others
with yellow scanty manes are found, not only in the same locality,
but even among individuals of the same parentage.</p>

<p>The lion belongs to the genus <i>Felis</i> of Linnaeus (for the
characters and position of which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>), and differs
from the tiger and leopard in its uniform colouring, and from
all the other <i>Felidae</i> in the hair of the top of the head, chin and
neck, as far back as the shoulder, being not only much longer,
but also differently disposed from the hair elsewhere, being
erect or directed forwards, and so constituting the characteristic
ornament called the mane. There is also a tuft of elongated
hairs at the end of the tail, one upon each elbow, and in most
lions a copious fringe along the middle line of the under surface
of the body, wanting, however, in some examples. These
characters are, however, peculiar to the adults of the male
sex; and even as regards coloration young lions show indications
of the darker stripes and mottlings so characteristic of the greater
number of the members of the genus. The usual colour of the
adult is yellowish-brown, but it may vary from a deep red or
chestnut brown to an almost silvery grey. The mane, as well
as the long hair of the other parts of the body, sometimes scarcely
differs from the general colour, but is usually darker and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page738" id="page738"></a>738</span>
unfrequently nearly black. The mane begins to grow when the
animal is about three years old, and is fully developed at five
or six.</p>

<p>In size the lion is only equalled or exceeded by the tiger among
existing <i>Felidae</i>; and though both species present great variations,
the largest specimens of the latter appear to surpass
the largest lions. A full-sized South African lion, according to
Selous, measures slightly less than 10 ft. from nose to tip of tail,
following the curves of the body. Sir Cornwallis Harris gives
10 ft. 6 in., of which the tail occupies 3 ft. The lioness is about
a foot less.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The internal structure of the lion, except in slight details, resembles
that of other <i>Felidae</i>, the whole organization being that of
an animal adapted for an active, predaceous existence. The teeth
especially exemplify the carnivorous type in its highest condition
of development. The most important function they have to perform,
that of seizing and holding firmly animals of considerable
size and strength, violently struggling for life, is provided for by
the great, sharp-pointed and sharp-edged canines, placed wide
apart at the angles of the mouth, the incisors between them being
greatly reduced in size and kept back nearly to the same level, so
as not to interfere with their action. The jaws are short and strong,
and the width of the zygomatic arches, and great development of
the bony ridges on the skull, give ample space for the attachment
of the powerful muscles by which they are closed. In the cheek-teeth
the sectorial or scissor-like cutting function is developed at
the expense of the tubercular or grinding, there being only one
rudimentary tooth of the latter form in the upper jaw, and none in
the lower. They are, however, sufficiently strong to break bones
of large size. The tongue is long and flat, and remarkable for the
development of the papillae of the anterior part of the dorsal surface,
which (except near the edge) are modified so as to resemble
long, compressed, recurved, horny spines or claws, which, near
the middle line, attain the length of one-fifth of an inch. They give
the part of the tongue on which they occur the appearance and feel
of a coarse rasp. The feet are furnished with round soft pads or
cushions covered with thick, naked skin, one on the under surface
of each of the principal toes, and one larger one of trilobed form,
behind these, under the lower ends of the metacarpal and metatarsal
bones, which are placed nearly vertically in ordinary progression.
The claws are large, strongly compressed, sharp, and exhibit the
retractile condition in the highest degree, being drawn backwards
and upwards into a sheath by the action of an elastic ligament
so long as the foot is in a state of repose, but exerted by muscular
action when the animal strikes its prey.</p>
</div>

<p>The lion lives chiefly in sandy plains and rocky places interspersed
with dense thorn-thickets, or frequents the low bushes
and tall rank grass and reeds that grow along the sides of streams
and near the springs where it lies in wait for the larger herbivorous
animals on which it feeds. Although occasionally
seen abroad during the day, especially in wild and desolate
regions, where it is subject to little molestation, the night
is, as in the case of so many other predaceous animals,
the period of its greatest activity. It is then that its characteristic
roar is chiefly heard, as thus graphically described by
Gordon-Cumming:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;One of the most striking things connected with the lion is his
voice, which is extremely grand and peculiarly striking. It consists
at times of a low deep moaning, repeated five or six times,
ending in faintly audible sighs; at other times he startles the
forest with loud, deep-toned, solemn roars, repeated in quick succession,
each increasing in loudness to the third or fourth, when his
voice dies away in five or six low muffled sounds very much resembling
distant thunder. At times, and not unfrequently, a troop may
be heard, roaring in concert, one assuming the lead, and two, three
or four more regularly taking up their parts, like persons singing a
catch. Like our Scottish stags at the rutting season, they roar
loudest in cold frosty nights; but on no occasions are their voices
to be heard in such perfection, or so intensely powerful, as when
two or three troops of strange lions approach a fountain to drink
at the same time. When this occurs, every member of each troop
sounds a bold roar of defiance at the opposite parties; and when
one roars, all roar together, and each seems to vie with his comrades
in the intensity and power of his voice. The power and
grandeur of these nocturnal concerts is inconceivably striking and
pleasing to the hunter&rsquo;s ear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The usual pace of a lion,&rdquo; C. J. Andersson says, &ldquo;is a walk,
and, though apparently rather slow, yet, from the great length
of his body, he is able to get over a good deal of ground in a
short time. Occasionally he trots, when his speed is not inconsiderable.
His gallop&mdash;or rather succession of bounds&mdash;is,
for a short distance, very fast&mdash;nearly or quite equal to that of a
horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lion, as with other members of the feline family,&rdquo; the
same writer says, &ldquo;seldom attacks his prey openly, unless
compelled by extreme hunger. For the most part he steals
upon it in the manner of a cat, or ambushes himself near to the
water or a pathway frequented by game. At such times he lies
crouched upon his belly in a thicket until the animal approaches
sufficiently near, when, with one prodigious bound, he pounces
upon it. In most cases he is successful, but should his intended
victim escape, as at times happens, from his having miscalculated
the distance, he may make a second or even a third bound,
which, however, usually prove fruitless, or he returns disconcerted
to his hiding-place, there to wait for another opportunity.&rdquo;
His food consists of all the larger herbivorous animals of the
country in which he resides&mdash;buffaloes, antelopes, zebras,
giraffes or even young elephants or rhinoceroses. In cultivated
districts cattle, sheep, and even human inhabitants are never
safe from his nocturnal ravages. He appears, however, as
a general rule, only to kill when hungry or attacked, and
not for the mere pleasure of killing, as with some other
carnivorous animals. He, moreover, by no means limits
himself to animals of his own killing, but, according to Selous,
often prefers eating game that has been killed by man, even
when not very fresh, to taking the trouble to catch an animal
himself.</p>

<p>The lion appears to be monogamous, a single male and female
continuing attached to each other irrespectively of the pairing
season. At all events the lion remains with the lioness while the
cubs are young and helpless, and assists in providing her and
them with food, and in educating them in the art of providing
for themselves. The number of cubs at a birth is from two to
four, usually three. They are said to remain with their parents
till they are about three years old.</p>

<p>Though not strictly gregarious, lions appear to be sociable
towards their own species, and often are found in small troops
sometimes consisting of a pair of old ones with their nearly full-grown
cubs, but occasionally of adults of the same sex; and there
seems to be evidence that several lions will associate for the
purpose of hunting upon a preconcerted plan. Their natural
ferocity and powerful armature are sometimes turned upon one
another; combats, often mortal, occur among male lions under
the influence of jealousy; and Andersson relates an instance of a
quarrel between a hungry lion and lioness over the carcase of an
antelope which they had just killed, and which did not seem
sufficient for the appetite of both, ending in the lion not only
killing, but devouring his mate. Old lions, whose teeth have
become injured with constant wear, become &ldquo;man-eaters,&rdquo;
finding their easiest means of obtaining a subsistence in lurking
in the neighbourhood of villages, and dashing into the tents at
night and carrying off one of the sleeping inmates. Lions never
climb.</p>

<p>With regard to the character of the lion, those who have had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page739" id="page739"></a>739</span>
opportunities of observing it in its native haunts differ greatly.
The accounts of early writers as to its courage, nobility and
magnanimity have led to a reaction, causing some modern authors
to accuse it of cowardice and meanness. Livingstone goes so
far as to say, &ldquo;nothing that I ever learned of the lion could
lead me to attribute to it either the ferocious or noble character
ascribed to it elsewhere,&rdquo; and he adds that its roar is not distinguishable
from that of the ostrich. These different estimates
depend to a great extent upon the particular standard of the
writer, and also upon the circumstance that lions, like other
animals, show considerable individual differences in character,
and behave differently under varying circumstances.</p>

born at Grenoble on the 11th of October 1611, of an old family
of Dauphiné. Early trained for diplomacy, his remarkable
abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Mazarin, who sent him
as secretary of the French embassy to the congress of Münster,
and, in 1642, on a mission to the pope. In 1646 he became
secretary to the queen regent; in 1653 obtained high office in
the king&rsquo;s household; and in 1654 was ambassador extraordinary
at the election of Pope Alexander VII. He was instrumental in
forming the league of the Rhine, by which Austria was cut off
from the Spanish Netherlands, and, as minister of state, was
associated with Mazarin in the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659),
which secured the marriage of Louis XIV. to the infanta Maria
Theresa. At the cardinal&rsquo;s dying request he was appointed his
successor in foreign affairs, and, for the next ten years, continued
to direct French foreign policy. Among his most important
diplomatic successes were the treaty of Breda (1667), the treaty
of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) and the sale of Dunkirk. He died in
Paris on the 1st of September 1671, leaving memoirs. He was
a man of pleasure, but his natural indolence gave place to an
unflagging energy when the occasion demanded it; and, in an
age of great ministers, his consummate statesmanship placed
him in the front rank.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIOTARD, JEAN ETIENNE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1702-1789), French painter, was
born at Geneva. He began his studies under Professor Gardelle
and Petitot, whose enamels and miniatures he copied with considerable
skill. He went to Paris in 1725, studying under J. B.
Massé and F. le Moyne, on whose recommendation he was taken
to Naples by the Marquis Puysieux. In 1735 he was in Rome,
painting the portraits of Pope Clement XII. and several cardinals.
Three years later he accompanied Lord Duncannon to Constantinople,
whence he went to Vienna in 1742 to paint the
portraits of the imperial family. His eccentric adoption of
oriental costume secured him the nickname of &ldquo;the Turkish
painter.&rdquo; Still under distinguished patronage he returned to
Paris in 1744, visited England, where he painted the princess of
Wales in 1753, and went to Holland in 1756, where, in the following
year, he married Marie Fargues. Another visit to England
followed in 1772, and in the next two years his name figures
among the Royal Academy exhibitors. He returned to his native
town in 1776 and died at Geneva in 1789.</p>

<p>Liotard was an artist of great versatility, and though his fame
depends largely on his graceful and delicate pastel drawings, of
which &ldquo;La Liseuse,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Chocolate Girl,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Belle
Lyonnaise&rdquo; at the Dresden Gallery are delightful examples,
he achieved distinction by his enamels, copper-plate engravings
and glass painting. He also wrote a <i>Treatise on the Art of Painting</i>,
and was an expert collector of paintings by the old masters.
Many of the masterpieces he had acquired were sold by him at
high prices on his second visit to England. The museums of
Amsterdam, Berne, and Geneva are particularly rich in examples
of his paintings and pastel drawings. A picture of a Turk seated
is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, while the British Museum
owns two of his drawings. The Louvre has, besides twenty-two
drawings, a portrait of General Hérault and a portrait of the
artist is to be found at the Sala dei pittori, in the Uffizi Gallery,
Florence.</p>

century and was increased gradually until 1889-1890 when
an insect pest destroyed the trees. The language of Lipa is
Tagalog.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPARI ISLANDS<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (anc. <span class="grk" title="Aiolou nêsoi">&#913;&#7984;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#957;&#8134;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span>, or <i>Aeoliae Insulae</i>),
a group of volcanic islands N. of the eastern portion of Sicily.
They are seven in number&mdash;Lipari (<i>Lipara</i>, pop. in 1901,
15,290), Stromboli (<i>Strongyle</i>), Salina (<i>Didyme</i>, pop. in 1901,
4934), Filicuri (<i>Phoenicusa</i>), Alicuri (<i>Ericusa</i>), Vulcano (<i>Hiera</i>,
<i>Therasia</i> or <i>Thermissa</i>), the mythical abode of Hephaestus,
and Panaria (<i>Euonymus</i>). The island of Aiolie, the home of
Aiolos, lord of the winds, which Ulysses twice visited in his
wanderings, has generally been identified with one of this group.
A colony of Cnidians and Rhodians was established on Lipara
in 580-577 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The inhabitants were allied with the Syracusans,
and were attacked by the Athenian fleet in 427 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and by the Carthaginians in 397 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, while Agathocles plundered
a temple on Lipara in 301 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> During the Punic wars the
islands were a Carthaginian naval station of some importance
until the Romans took possession of them in 252 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Sextus
Pompeius also used them as a naval base. Under the Empire
the islands served as a place of banishment for political prisoners.
In the middle ages they frequently changed hands. The island
of Lipari contains the chief town (population in 1901, 5855), which
bears the same name and had municipal rights in Roman times.
It is the seat of a bishop. It is fertile and contains sulphur springs
and vapour baths, which were known and used in ancient times.
Pumicestone is exported.</p>

<p>Stromboli, 22 m. N.E. of Lipari, is a constantly active volcano,
ejecting gas and lava at brief intervals, and always visible at
night. Salina, 3 m. N.W. of Lipari, consisting of the cones of
two extinct volcanoes, that on the S.E., Monte Salvatore (3155
ft.), being the highest point in the islands, is the most fertile
of the whole group and produces good Malmsey wine: it takes
its name from the salt-works on the south coast. Vulcano, ½ m.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page740" id="page740"></a>740</span>
S. of Lipari, contains a still smoking crater. Sulphur works
were started in 1874, have since been abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPPE,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> a river of Germany, a right-bank tributary of the
Rhine. It rises near Lippspringe under the western declivity
of the Teutoburger Wald, and, after being joined by the Alme,
the Pader and the Ahse on the left, and by the Stever on the
right, flows into the Rhine near Wesel, after a course of 154 m.
It is navigable downwards from Lippstadt, for boats and barges,
by the aid of twelve locks, drawing less than 4 ft. of water.
The river is important for the transport facilities it affords
to the rich agricultural districts of Westphalia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPPE,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> a principality of Germany and constituent state of the
German empire, bounded N.W., W. and S. by the Prussian
province of Westphalia and N.E. and E. by the Prussian provinces
of Hanover and Hesse-Nassau and the principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont.
It also possesses three small enclaves&mdash;Kappel
and Lipperode in Westphalia and Grevenhagen near Höxter.
The area is 469 sq. m., and the population (1905) 145,610,
showing a density of 125 to the sq. m. The greater part of the
surface is hilly, and in the S. and W., where the Teutoburger
Wald practically forms its physical boundary, mountainous.
The chief rivers are the Weser, which crosses the north extremity
of the principality, and its affluents, the Werre, Exter, Kalle
and Emmer. The Lippe, which gives its name to the country,
is a purely Westphalian river and does not touch the principality
at any point. The forests of Lippe, among the finest in Germany,
produce abundance of excellent timber. They occupy 28%
of the whole area, and consist mostly of deciduous trees, beech
preponderating. The valleys contain a considerable amount
of good arable land, the tillage of which employs the greater
part of the inhabitants. Small farms, the larger proportion
of which are under 2½ acres, are numerous, and their yield shows
a high degree of prosperity among the peasant farmers. The
principal crops are potatoes, beetroot (for sugar), hay, rye,
oats, wheat and barley. Cattle, sheep and swine are also
reared, and the &ldquo;Senner&rdquo; breed of horses, in the stud farm
at Lopshorn, is celebrated. The industries are small and consist
mainly in the manufacture of starch, paper, sugar, tobacco,
and in weaving and brewing. Lemgo is famous for its meerschaum
pipes and Salzuflen for its brine-springs, producing annually
about 1500 tons of salt, which is mostly exported. Each
year, in spring, about 15,000 brickmakers leave the principality
and journey to other countries, Hungary, Sweden and Russia,
to return home in the late autumn.</p>

<p>The roads are well laid and kept in good repair. A railway
intersects the country from Herford (on the Cologne-Hanover
main line) to Altenbeken; and another from Bielefeld to Hameln
traverses it from W. to E. More than 95% of the population
in 1905 were Protestants. Education is provided for by two
gymnasia and numerous other efficient schools. The principality
contains seven small towns, the chief of which are Detmold,
the seat of government, Lemgo, Horn and Blomberg. The
present constitution was granted in 1836, but it was altered in
1867 and again in 1876. It provides for a representative chamber
of twenty-one members, whose functions are mainly consultative.
For electoral purposes the population is divided into three
classes, rated according to taxation, each of which returns
seven members. The courts of law are centred at Detmold,
whence an appeal lies to the court of appeal at Celle in the
Prussian province of Hanover. The estimated revenue in
1909 was £113,000 and the expenditure £116,000. The public
debt in 1908 was £64,000. Lippe has one vote in the German
Reichstag, and also one vote in the Bundesrat, or federal council.
Its military forces form a battalion of the 6th Westphalian
infantry.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The present principality of Lippe was inhabited
in early times by the Cherusii, whose leader Arminius (Hermann)
annihilated in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 9 the legions of Varus in the Teutoburger
Wald. It was afterwards occupied by the Saxons and was
subdued by Charlemagne. The founder of the present reigning
family, one of the most ancient in Germany, was Bernard I.
(1113-1144), who received a grant of the territory from the
emperor Lothair, and assumed the title of lord of Lippe (<i>edler
Herr von Lippe</i>). He was descended from a certain Hoold who
flourished about 950. Bernard&rsquo;s successors inherited or obtained
several counties, and one of them, Simon III. (d. 1410), introduced
the principles of primogeniture. Under Simon V. (d. 1536),
who was the first to style himself count, the Reformation was
introduced into the country. His grandson, Simon VI. (1555-1613),
is the ancestor of both lines of the princes of Lippe. In
1613 the country, as it then existed, was divided among his
three sons, the lines founded by two of whom still exist, while
the third (Brake) became extinct in 1709. Lippe proper was
the patrimony of the eldest son, Simon VII. (1587-1627), upon
whose descendant Frederick William Leopold (d. 1802) the title
of prince of the empire was bestowed in 1789, a dignity already
conferred, though not confirmed, in 1720. Philip, the youngest
son of Simon VI., received but a scanty part of his father&rsquo;s
possessions, but in 1640 he inherited a large part of the countship
of Schaumburg, including Bückeburg, and adopted the
title of count of Schaumburg-Lippe. The ruler of this territory
became a sovereign prince in 1807. Simon VII. had a younger
son, Jobst Hermann (d. 1678), who founded the line of counts
of Lippe-Biesterfeld, and a cadet branch of this family were
the counts of Lippe-Weissenfeld. In 1762 these two counties&mdash;Biesterfeld
and Weissenfeld&mdash;passed by arrangement into the
possession of the senior and ruling branch of the family. Under
the prudent government of the princess Pauline (from 1802
to 1820), widow of Frederick William Leopold, the little state
enjoyed great prosperity. In 1807 it joined the Confederation
of the Rhine and in 1813 the German Confederation. Pauline&rsquo;s
son, Paul Alexander Leopold, who reigned from 1820 to 1851,
also ruled in a wise and liberal spirit, and in 1836 granted the
charter of rights upon which the constitution is based. In 1842
Lippe entered the German Customs Union (<i>Zollverein</i>), and in
1866 threw in its lot with Prussia and joined the North German
Confederation.</p>

<p>The line of rulers in Lippe dates back, as already mentioned,
to Simon VI. But besides this, the senior line, the two collateral
lines of counts, Lippe-Biesterfeld and Lippe-Weissenfeld
and the princely line of Schaumburg-Lippe,
<span class="sidenote">The Lippe succession dispute.</span>
also trace their descent to the same ancestor, and these
three lines stand in the above order as regards their
rights to the Lippe succession, the counts being descended from
Simon&rsquo;s eldest son and the princes from his youngest son.
These facts were not in dispute when in March 1895 the death
of Prince Woldemar, who had reigned since 1875, raised a dispute
as to the succession. Woldemar&rsquo;s brother Alexander, the last
of the senior line, was hopelessly insane and had been declared
incapable of ruling. On the death of Woldemar, Prince Adolph
of Schaumburg-Lippe, fourth son of Prince Adolph George of
that country and brother-in-law of the German emperor, took
over the regency by virtue of a decree issued by Prince Woldemar,
but which had until the latter&rsquo;s death been kept secret. The
Lippe house of representatives consequently passed a special
law confirming the regency in the person of Prince Adolph,
but with the proviso that the regency should be at an end as
soon as the disputes touching the succession were adjusted;
and with a further proviso that, should this dispute not have
been settled before the death of Prince Alexander, then, if a
competent court of law had been secured before that event
happened, the regency of Prince Adolph should continue until
such court had given its decision. The dispute in question had
arisen because the heads of the two collateral countly lines had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page741" id="page741"></a>741</span>
entered a <i>caveat</i>. In order to adjust matters the Lippe government
moved the <i>Bundesrat</i>, on the 5th of July 1895, to pass an
imperial law declaring the <i>Reichsgericht</i> (the supreme tribunal
of the empire) a competent court to adjudicate upon the claims
of the rival lines to the succession. In consequence the Bundesrat
passed a resolution on the 1st of February 1896, requesting the
chancellor of the empire to bring about a compromise for the
appointment of a court of arbitration between the parties.
Owing to the mediation of the chancellor a compact was on the
3rd of July 1896 concluded between the heads of the three
collateral lines of the whole house of Lippe, binding &ldquo;both on
themselves and on the lines of which they were the heads.&rdquo;
By clause 2 of this compact, a court of arbitration was to be
appointed, consisting of the king of Saxony and six members
selected by him from among the members of the supreme court
of law of the empire. This court was duly constituted, and on
the 22nd of June 1897 delivered judgment to the effect that
Count Ernest of Lippe-Biesterfeld, head of the line of Lippe-Biesterfeld,
was entitled to succeed to the throne of Lippe on
the death of Prince Alexander. In consequence of this judgment
Prince Adolph resigned the regency and Count Ernest became
regent in his stead. On the 26th of September 1904 Count Ernest
died and his eldest son, Count Leopold, succeeded to the regency;
but the question of the succession was again raised by the prince
of Schaumburg-Lippe, who urged that the marriage of Count
William Ernest, father of Count Ernest, with Modeste von Unruh,
and that of the count regent Ernest himself with Countess
Carline von Wartensleben were not <i>ebenbürtig</i> (equal birth),
and that the issue of these marriages were therefore excluded
from the succession. Prince George of Schaumburg-Lippe and
the count regent, Leopold, thereupon entered into a compact,
again referring the matter to the Bundesrat, which requested
the chancellor of the empire to agree to the appointment of a
court of arbitration consisting of two civil senates of the supreme
court, sitting at Leipzig, to decide finally the matter in dispute.
It was further provided in the compact that Leopold should
remain as regent, even after the death of Alexander, until the
decision of the court had been given. Prince Alexander died on
the 13th of January 1905; Count Leopold remained as regent,
and on the 25th of October the court of arbitration issued its
award, declaring the marriages in question (which were, as proved
by document, contracted with the consent of the head of the
house in each case) <i>ebenbürtig</i>, and that in pursuance of the award
of the king of Saxony the family of Lippe-Biesterfeld, together
with the collateral lines sprung from Count William Ernest
(father of the regent, Count Ernest) were in the order of nearest
agnates called to the succession. Leopold (b. 1871) thus became
prince of Lippe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPPI,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> the name of three celebrated Italian painters.</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">Fra Filippo Lippi</span> (1406-1469), commonly called Lippo
Lippi, one of the most renowned painters of the Italian quattrocento,
was born in Florence&mdash;his father, Tommaso, being a
butcher. His mother died in his childhood, and his father
survived his wife only two years. His aunt, a poor woman
named Monna Lapaccia, then took charge of the boy; and in
1420, when fourteen years of age, he was registered in the
community of the Carmelite friars of the Carmine in Florence.
Here he remained till 1432, and his early faculty for fine arts
was probably developed by studying the works of Masaccio
in the neighbouring chapel of the Brancacci. Between 1430
and 1432 he executed some works in the monastery, which were
destroyed by a fire in 1771; they are specified by Vasari, and
one of them was particularly marked by its resemblance to
Masaccio&rsquo;s style. Eventually Fra Filippo quitted his convent,
but it appears that he was not relieved from some sort of religious
vow; in a letter dated in 1439 he speaks of himself as the poorest
friar of Florence, and says he is charged with the maintenance
of six marriageable nieces. In 1452 he was appointed chaplain
to the convent of S. Giovannino in Florence, and in 1457 rector
(<i>Rettore Commendatario</i>) of S. Quirico at Legania, and his
gains were considerable and uncommonly large from time to
time; but his poverty seems to have been chronic, the money
being spent, according to one account, in frequently recurring
amours.</p>

<p>Vasari relates some curious and romantic adventures of Fra
Filippo, which modern biographers are not inclined to believe.
Except through Vasari, nothing is known of his visits to Ancona
and Naples, and his intermediate capture by Barbary pirates
and enslavement in Barbary, whence his skill in portrait-sketching
availed to release him. This relates to a period, 1431-1437,
when his career is not otherwise clearly accounted for. The
doubts thrown upon his semi-marital relations with a Florentine
lady appear, however, to be somewhat arbitrary; Vasari&rsquo;s
account is circumstantial, and in itself not greatly improbable.
Towards June 1456 Fra Filippo was settled in Prato (near
Florence) for the purpose of fulfilling a commission to paint
frescoes in the choir of the cathedral. Before actually undertaking
this work he set about painting, in 1458, a picture for the convent
chapel of S. Margherita of Prato, and there saw Lucrezia Buti,
the beautiful daughter of a Florentine, Francesco Buti; she
was either a novice or a young lady placed under the nuns&rsquo;
guardianship. Lippi asked that she might be permitted to sit
to him for the figure of the Madonna (or it might rather appear
of S. Margherita); he made passionate love to her, abducted
her to his own house, and kept her there spite of the utmost
efforts the nuns could make to reclaim her. The fruit of their
loves was a boy, who became the painter, not less celebrated
than his father, Filippino Lippi (noticed below). Such is substantially
Vasari&rsquo;s narrative, published less than a century after
the alleged events; it is not refuted by saying, more than three
centuries later, that perhaps Lippo had nothing to do with
any such Lucrezia, and perhaps Lippino was his adopted son,
or only an ordinary relative and scholar. The argument that
two reputed portraits of Lucrezia in paintings by Lippo are not
alike, one as a Madonna in a very fine picture in the Pitti gallery,
and the other in the same character in a Nativity in the Louvre,
comes to very little; and it is reduced to nothing when the
disputant adds that the Louvre painting is probably not done
by Lippi at all. Besides, it appears more likely that not the
Madonna in the Louvre but a S. Margaret in a picture now in
the Gallery of Prato is the original portrait (according to the
tradition) of Lucrezia Buti.</p>

<p>The frescoes in the choir of Prato cathedral, being the stories of
the Baptist and of St Stephen, represented on the two opposite
wall spaces, are the most important and monumental works
which Fra Filippo has left, more especially the figure of Salome
dancing, and the last of the series, showing the ceremonial
mourning over Stephen&rsquo;s corpse. This contains a portrait of the
painter, but which is the proper figure is a question that has
raised some diversity of opinion. At the end wall of the choir
are S. Giovanni Gualberto and S. Alberto, and on the ceiling the
four evangelists.</p>

<p>The close of Lippi&rsquo;s life was spent at Spoleto, where he had been
commissioned to paint, for the apse of the cathedral, some scenes
from the life of the Virgin. In the semidome of the apse is Christ
crowning the Madonna, with angels, sibyls and prophets. This
series, which is not wholly equal to the one at Prato, was completed
by Fra Diamante after Lippi&rsquo;s death. That Lippi died
in Spoleto, on or about the 8th of October 1469, is an undoubted
fact; the mode of his death is again a matter of dispute. It
has been said that the pope granted Lippi a dispensation for
marrying Lucrezia, but that, before the permission arrived,
he had been poisoned by the indignant relatives either of Lucrezia
herself, or of some lady who had replaced her in the inconstant
painter&rsquo;s affections. This is now generally regarded as a fable;
and indeed a vendetta upon a man aged sixty-three for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page742" id="page742"></a>742</span>
seduction committed at the already mature age of fifty-two
seems hardly plausible. Fra Filippo lies buried in Spoleto, with
a monument erected to him by Lorenzo the Magnificent; he had
always been zealously patronized by the Medici family, beginning
with Cosimo, Pater Patriae. Francesco di Pesello (called Pesellino)
and Sandro Botticelli were among his most distinguished
pupils.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1441 Lippi painted an altarpiece for the nuns of S. Ambrogio
which is now a prominent attraction in the Academy of Florence,
and has been celebrated in Browning&rsquo;s well-known poem. It represents
the coronation of the Virgin among angels and saints, of
whom many are Bernardine monks. One of these, placed to the
right, is a half-length portrait of Lippo, pointed out by an inscription
upon an angel&rsquo;s scroll &ldquo;Is perfecit opus.&rdquo; The price paid for this
work in 1447 was 1200 Florentine lire, which seems surprisingly
large. For Germiniano Inghirami of Prato he painted the &ldquo;Death of
St Bernard,&rdquo; a fine specimen still extant. His principal altarpiece
in this city is a Nativity in the refectory of S. Domenico&mdash;the Infant
on the ground adored by the Virgin and Joseph, between Sts George
and Dominic, in a rocky landscape, with the shepherds playing and
six angels in the sky. In the Uffizi is a fine Virgin adoring the infant
Christ, who is held by two angels; in the National Gallery, London, a
&ldquo;Vision of St Bernard.&rdquo; The picture of the &ldquo;Virgin and Infant with
an Angel,&rdquo; in this same gallery, also ascribed to Lippi, is disputable.</p>

<p>Few pictures are so thoroughly enjoyable as those of Lippo Lippi;
they show the naiveté of a strong, rich nature, redundant in lively and
somewhat whimsical observation. He approaches religious art from
its human side, and is not pietistic though true to a phase of Catholic
devotion. He was perhaps the greatest colourist and technical adept
of his time, with good draughtsmanship&mdash;a naturalist, with less
vulgar realism than some of his contemporaries, and with much
genuine episodical animation, including semi-humorous incidents
and low characters. He made little effort after perspective and none
for foreshortenings, was fond of ornamenting pilasters and other
architectural features. Vasari says that Lippi was wont to hide the
extremities in drapery to evade difficulties. His career was one of
continual development, without fundamental variation in style or
in colouring. In his great works the proportions are larger than
life.</p>

<p>Along with Vasari&rsquo;s interesting and amusing, and possibly not
very unauthentic, account of Lippo Lippi, the work of Crowe and
Cavalcaselle should be consulted. Also: E. C. Strutt, <i>Fra Lippo
Lippi</i> (1901); C. M. Phillimore, <i>Early Florentine Painters</i> (1881);
B. Supino, <i>Fra Filippo Lippi</i> (illustrated) (1902). It should be
observed that Crowe and Cavalcaselle give 1412 as the date of the
painter&rsquo;s birth, and this would make a considerable difference in
estimating details of his after career. We have preferred to follow
the more usual account. The self-portrait dated 1441 looks like a
man much older than twenty-nine.</p>
</div>

<p>II. <span class="sc">Filippino</span>, or <span class="sc">Lippino Lippi</span> (1460-1505), was the natural
son of Fra Lippo Lippi and Lucrezia Buti, born in Florence and
educated at Prato. Losing his father before he had completed
his tenth year, the boy took up his avocation as a painter,
studying under Sandro Botticelli and probably under Fra
Diamante. The style which he formed was to a great extent
original, but it bears clear traces of the manner both of Lippo
and of Botticelli&mdash;more ornamental than the first, more realistic
and less poetical than the second. His powers developed early;
for we find him an accomplished artist by 1480, when he painted
an altarpiece, the &ldquo;Vision of St Bernard,&rdquo; now in the Badia of
Florence; it is in tempera, with almost the same force as oil
painting. Soon afterwards, probably from 1482 to 1490, he
began to work upon the frescoes which completed the decoration
of the Brancacci chapel in the Carmine, commenced by Masolino
and Masaccio many years before. He finished Masaccio&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Resurrection of the King&rsquo;s Son,&rdquo; and was the sole author of
&ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s Interview with Peter in Prison,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Liberation of
Peter,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Two Saints before the Proconsul&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Crucifixion
of Peter.&rdquo; These works are sufficient to prove that Lippino
stood in the front rank of the artists of his time. The dignified
and expressive figure of St Paul in the second-named subject
has always been particularly admired, and appears to have
furnished a suggestion to Raphael for his &ldquo;Paul at Athens.&rdquo;
Portraits of Luigi Pulci, Antonio Pollajuolo, Lippino himself and
various others are in this series. In 1485 he executed the great
altarpiece of the &ldquo;Virgin and Saints,&rdquo; with several other figures,
now in the Uffizi Gallery. Another of his leading works is the
altarpiece for the Nerli chapel in S. Spirito&mdash;the &ldquo;Virgin Enthroned,&rdquo;
with splendidly living portraits of Nerli and his wife,
and a thronged distance. In 1489 Lippino was in Rome, painting
in the church of the Minerva, having first passed through Spoleto
to design the monument for his father in the cathedral of that
city. Some of his principal frescoes in the Minerva are still
extant, the subjects being in celebration of St Thomas Aquinas.
In one picture the saint is miraculously commended by a crucifix;
in another, triumphing over heretics. In 1496 Lippino painted
the &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi&rdquo; now in the Uffizi, a very striking
picture, with numerous figures. This was succeeded by his last
important undertaking, the frescoes in the Strozzi chapel, in the
church of S. Maria Novella in Florence&mdash;&ldquo;Drusiana Restored to
Life by St John, the Evangelist,&rdquo; &ldquo;St John in the Cauldron of
Boiling Oil&rdquo; and two subjects from the legend of St Philip.
These are conspicuous and attractive works, yet somewhat
grotesque and exaggerated&mdash;full of ornate architecture, showy
colour and the distinctive peculiarities of the master. Filippino,
who had married in 1497, died in 1505. The best reputed of his
scholars was Raffaellino del Garbo.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Like his father, Filippino had a most marked original genius for
painting, and he was hardly less a chief among the artists of his
time than Fra Filippo had been in his; it may be said that in all
the annals of the art a rival instance is not to be found of a father
and son each of whom had such pre-eminent natural gifts and
leadership. The father displayed more of sentiment and candid
sweetness of motive; the son more of richness, variety and lively
pictorial combination. He was admirable in all matters of decorative
adjunct and presentment, such as draperies, landscape backgrounds
and accessories; and he was the first Florentine to introduce
a taste for antique details of costume, &amp;c. He formed a large
collection of objects of this kind, and left his designs of them to
his son. In his later works there is a tendency to a mannered
development of the extremities, and generally to facile overdoing.
The National Gallery, London, possesses a good and characteristic
though not exactly a first-rate specimen of Lippino, the &ldquo;Virgin and
Child between Sts Jerome and Dominic&rdquo;; also an &ldquo;Adoration of
the Magi,&rdquo; of which recent criticism contests the authenticity.
Crowe and Cavalcaselle, supplemented by the writings of Berenson,
should be consulted as to this painter. An album of his works is in
Newnes&rsquo; Art-library.</p>

<p>III. <span class="sc">Lorenzo Lippi</span> (1606-1664), painter and poet, was born
in Florence. He studied painting under Matteo Rosselli, the
influence of whose style, and more especially of that of Santi di
Tito, is to be traced in Lippi&rsquo;s works, which are marked by taste,
delicacy and a strong turn for portrait-like naturalism. His
maxim was &ldquo;to poetize as he spoke, and to paint as he saw.&rdquo;
After exercising his art for some time in Florence, and having
married at the age of forty the daughter of a rich sculptor named
Susini, Lippi went as court painter to Innsbruck, where he has
left many excellent portraits. There he wrote his humorous poem
named <i>Malmantile Racquistato</i>, which was published under the
anagrammatic pseudonym of &ldquo;Perlone Zipoli.&rdquo; Lippi was somewhat
self-sufficient, and, when visiting Parma, would not look
at the famous Correggios there, saying that they could teach him
nothing. He died of pleurisy in 1664, in Florence.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most esteemed works of Lippi as a painter are a &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo;
in the Uffizi gallery at Florence, and a &ldquo;Triumph of David&rdquo;
which he executed for the saloon of Angiolo Galli, introducing into
it portraits of the seventeen children of the owner. The <i>Malmantile
Racquistato</i> is a burlesque romance, mostly compounded out of a
variety of popular tales; its principal subject-matter is an expedition
for the recovery of a fortress and territory whose queen
had been expelled by a female usurper. It is full of graceful or racy
Florentine idioms, and is counted by Italians as a &ldquo;testo di lingua.&rdquo;
Lippi is more generally or more advantageously remembered by this
poem than by anything which he has left in the art of painting.
It was not published until 1688, several years after his death.
Lanzi as to Lorenzo Lippi&rsquo;s pictorial work, and Tiraboschi and
other literary historians as to his writings, are among the best
authorities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPSIUS, JUSTUS<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1547-1606), the Latinized name of Joest
(Juste or Josse) Lips, Belgian scholar, born on the 18th of
October (15th of November, according to Amiel) 1547 at
Overyssche, a small village in Brabant, near Brussels. Sent
early to the Jesuit college in Cologne, he was removed at the age
of sixteen to the university of Louvain by his parents, who feared
that he might be induced to become a member of the Society of
Jesus. The publication of his <i>Variarum Lectionum Libri Tres</i>
(1567), dedicated to Cardinal Granvella, procured him an appointment
as Latin secretary and a visit to Rome in the retinue of the
cardinal. Here Lipsius remained two years, devoting his spare
time to the study of the Latin classics, collecting inscriptions and
examining MSS. in the Vatican. A second volume of miscellaneous
criticism (<i>Antiquarum Lectionum Libri Quinque</i>, 1575),
published after his return from Rome, compared with the
<i>Variae Lectiones</i> of eight years earlier, shows that he had advanced
from the notion of purely conjectural emendation to that of
emending by collation. In 1570 he wandered over Burgundy,
Germany, Austria, Bohemia, and was engaged for more than a
year as teacher in the university of Jena, a position which implied
an outward conformity to the Lutheran Church. On his way
back to Louvain, he stopped some time at Cologne, where he
must have comported himself as a Catholic. He then returned to
<span class="correction" title="amended from Louvian">Louvain</span>, but was soon driven by the Civil War to take refuge
in Antwerp, where he received, in 1579, a call to the newly
founded university of Leiden, as professor of history. At Leiden,
where he must have passed as a Calvinist, Lipsius remained
eleven years, the period of his greatest productivity. It was
now that he prepared his <i>Seneca</i>, perfected, in successive editions,
his <i>Tacitus</i> and brought out a series of works, some of pure
scholarship, others collections from classical authors, others again
of general interest. Of this latter class was a treatise on politics
(<i>Politicorum Libri Sex</i>, 1589), in which he showed that, though a
public teacher in a country which professed toleration, he had
not departed from the state maxims of Alva and Philip II.
He lays it down that a government should recognize only one
religion, and that dissent should be extirpated by fire and
sword. From the attacks to which this avowal exposed him, he
was saved by the prudence of the authorities of Leiden, who
prevailed upon him to publish a declaration that his expression,
<i>Ure, seca</i>, was a metaphor for a vigorous treatment. In the
spring of 1590, leaving Leiden under pretext of taking the waters
at Spa, he went to Mainz, where he was reconciled to the Roman
Catholic Church. The event deeply interested the Catholic
world, and invitations poured in on Lipsius from the courts and
universities of Italy, Austria and Spain. But he preferred to
remain in his own country, and finally settled at Louvain, as
professor of Latin in the Collegium Buslidianum. He was not
expected to teach, and his trifling stipend was eked out by the
appointments of privy councillor and historiographer to the king
of Spain. He continued to publish dissertations as before, the
chief being his <i>De militia romana</i> (Antwerp, 1595) and <i>Lovanium</i>
(Antwerp, 1605; 4th ed., Wesel, 1671), intended as an introduction
to a general history of Brabant. He died at <span class="correction" title="amended from Louvian">Louvain</span> on
the 23rd of March (some give 24th of April) 1606.</p>

<p>Lipsius&rsquo;s knowledge of classical antiquity was extremely
limited. He had but slight acquaintance with Greek, and in
Latin literature the poets and Cicero lay outside his range.
His greatest work was his edition of Tacitus. This author he
had so completely made his own that he could repeat the whole,
and offered to be tested in any part of the text, with a poniard
held to his breast, to be used against him if he should fail. His
<i>Tacitus</i> first appeared in 1575, and was five times revised and
corrected&mdash;the last time in 1606, shortly before his death. His
<i>Opera Omnia</i> appeared in 8 vols. at Antwerp (1585, 2nd ed.,
1637).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPSIUS, RICHARD ADELBERT<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (1830-1892), German
Protestant theologian, son of K. H. A. Lipsius (d. 1861), who
was rector of the school of St Thomas at Leipzig, was born at
Gera on the 14th of February 1830. He studied at Leipzig, and
eventually (1871) settled at Jena as professor ordinarius. He
helped to found the &ldquo;Evangelical Protestant Missionary Union&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Evangelical Alliance,&rdquo; and from 1874 took an active
part in their management. He died at Jena on the 19th of August
1892. Lipsius wrote principally on dogmatics and the history
of early Christianity from a liberal and critical standpoint. A
Neo-Kantian, he was to some extent an opponent of Albrecht
Ritschl, demanding &ldquo;a connected and consistent theory of the
universe, which shall comprehend the entire realm of our experience
as a whole. He rejects the doctrine of dualism in a
truth, one division of which would be confined to &lsquo;judgments of
value,&rsquo; and be unconnected with our theoretical knowledge of the
external world. The possibility of combining the results of our
scientific knowledge with the declarations of our ethico-religious
experience, so as to form a consistent philosophy, is based,
according to Lipsius, upon the unity of the personal ego, which
on the one hand knows the world scientifically, and on the other
regards it as the means of realizing the ethico-religious object of
its life&rdquo; (Otto Pfleiderer). This, in part, is his attitude in
<i>Philosophie und Religion</i> (1885). In his <i>Lehrbuch der evang.-prot.
Dogmatik</i> (1876; 3rd ed., 1893) he deals in detail with the
doctrines of &ldquo;God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Justification&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Church.&rdquo; From 1875 he assisted K. Hase, O. Pfleiderer and
E. Schrader in editing the <i>Jahrbücher für prot. Theologie</i>, and
from 1885 till 1891 he edited the <i>Theol. Jahresbericht</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIPTON, SIR THOMAS JOHNSTONE,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1850-&emsp;&emsp;),
British merchant, was born at Glasgow in 1850, of Irish parents.
At a very early age he was employed as errand boy to a Glasgow
stationer; at fifteen he emigrated to America, where at first he
worked in a grocery store, and afterwards as a tram-car driver in
New Orleans, as a traveller for a portrait firm, and on a plantation
in South Carolina. Eventually, having saved some money, he
returned to Glasgow and opened a small provision shop. Business
gradually increased, and by degrees Lipton had provision
shops first all over Scotland and then all over the United Kingdom.
To supply his retail shops on the most favourable terms, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page744" id="page744"></a>744</span>
purchased extensive tea, coffee and cocoa plantations in Ceylon,
and provided his own packing-house for hogs in Chicago, and
fruit farms, jam factories, bakeries and bacon-curing establishments
in England. In 1898 his business was converted into a
limited liability company. At Queen Victoria&rsquo;s diamond jubilee
in 1897 he gave £20,000 for providing dinners for a large number
of the London poor. In 1898 he was knighted, and in 1902 was
made a baronet. In the world of yacht-racing he became well
known from his repeated attempts to win the America Cup.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIQUEURS,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> the general term applied to perfumed or flavoured
potable spirits, sweetened by the addition of sugar. The term
&ldquo;liqueur&rdquo; is also used for certain wines and unsweetened spirits
of very superior quality, or remarkable for their bouquet, such
as tokay or fine old brandy or whisky. The basis of all the
&ldquo;liqueurs&rdquo; proper consists of (<i>a</i>) relatively strong alcohol or
spirit, which must be as pure and neutral as possible; (<i>b</i>) sugar
or syrup; and (<i>c</i>) flavouring matters. There are three distinct
main methods of manufacturing liqueurs. The first, by which
liqueurs of the highest class are prepared, is the &ldquo;distillation&rdquo;
or &ldquo;alcoholate&rdquo; process. This consists in macerating various
aromatic substances such as seeds, leaves, roots and barks of
plants, &amp;c., with strong spirit and subsequently distilling the
infusion so obtained generally in the presence of a whole or a
part of the solid matter. The mixture of spirit, water and
flavouring matters which distils over is termed the &ldquo;alcoholate.&rdquo;
To this is added a solution of sugar or syrup, and frequently
colouring matter in the shape of harmless vegetable extracts or
burnt sugar, and a further quantity of flavouring matter in the
shape of essential oils or clear spirituous vegetable extracts.
The second method of making liqueurs is that known as the
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; process. It is employed, as a rule, for cheap and
inferior articles; the process resolving itself into the addition
of various essential oils, either natural or artificially prepared,
and of spirituous extracts to strong spirit, filtering and adding
the saccharine matter to the clear filtrate. The third method
of manufacturing liqueurs is the &ldquo;infusion&rdquo; process, in
which alcohol and sugar are added to various fresh fruit
juices. Liqueurs prepared by this method are frequently called
&ldquo;cordials.&rdquo; It has been suggested that &ldquo;cordials&rdquo; are articles
of home manufacture, and that liqueurs are necessarily of foreign
origin, but it is at least doubtful whether this is entirely correct.
The French, who excel in the preparation of liqueurs, grade their
products, according to their sweetness and alcoholic strength,
into <i>crêmes</i>, <i>huiles</i> or <i>baumes</i>, which have a thick, oily consistency;
and <i>eaux</i>, <i>extraits</i> or <i>élixirs</i>, which, being less sweetened,
are relatively limpid. Liqueurs are also classed, according to
their commercial quality and composition, as <i>ordinaires</i>, <i>demi-fines</i>,
<i>fines</i> and <i>sur-fines</i>. Certain liqueurs, containing only a
single flavouring ingredient, or having a prevailing flavour of a
particular substance, are named after that body, for instance,
<i>crême de vanille</i>, <i>anisette</i>, <i>kümmel</i>, <i>crême de menthe</i>, &amp;c. On the
other hand, many well-known liqueurs are compounded of very
numerous aromatic principles. The nature and quantities of the
flavouring agents employed in the preparation of liqueurs of
this kind are kept strictly secret, but numerous &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; are
given in works dealing with this subject. Among the substances
frequently used as flavouring agents are aniseed, coriander,
fennel, wormwood, gentian, sassafras, amber, hyssop, mint,
thyme, angelica, citron, lemon and orange peel, peppermint,
cinnamon, cloves, iris, caraway, tea, coffee and so on. The
alcoholic strength of liqueurs ranges from close on 80% of
alcohol by volume in some kinds of absinthe, to 27% in anisette.
The liqueur industry is a very considerable one, there being in
France some 25,000 factories. Most of these are small, but
some 600,000 gallons are annually exported from France alone.
For absinthe, benedictine, chartreuse, curaçoa, kirsch and
vermouth see under separate headings. Among other well-known
trade liqueurs may be mentioned maraschino, which takes
its name from a variety of cherry&mdash;the marasca&mdash;grown in
Dalmatia, the centre of the trade being at Zara; kümmel, the
flavour of which is largely due to caraway seeds; allasch,
which is a rich variety of kümmel; and cherry and other &ldquo;fruit&rdquo;
brandies and whiskies, the latter being perhaps more properly
termed cordials.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIQUIDAMBAR,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> <span class="sc">Liquid Amber</span> or <span class="sc">Sweet Gum</span>, a product of
<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> (order Hamamelideae), a deciduous
tree of from 80 to 140 ft. high, with a straight trunk 4 or 5 ft. in
diameter, a native of the United States, Mexico and Central
America. It bears palmately-lobed leaves, somewhat resembling
those of the maple, but larger. The male and female inflorescences
are on different branches of the same tree, the globular
heads of fruit resembling those of the plane. This species is
nearly allied to <i>L. orientalis</i>, a native of a very restricted portion
of the south-west coast of Asia Minor, where it forms forests.
The earliest record of the tree appears to be in a Spanish work by
F. Hernandez, published in 1651, in which he describes it as a
large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber,
whence the name (<i>Nov. Plant.</i>, &amp;c., p. 56). In Ray&rsquo;s <i>Historia
Plantarum</i> (1686) it is called <i>Styrax liquida</i>. It was introduced
into Europe in 1681 by John Banister, the missionary collector
sent out by Bishop Compton, who planted it in the palace gardens
at Fulham. The wood is very compact and fine-grained&mdash;the
heart-wood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked
transversely with blackish belts. It is employed for veneering
in America. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes used
instead of ebony for picture frames, balusters, &amp;c.; but it is
too liable to decay for outdoor work.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The gum resin yielded by this tree has no special medicinal
virtues, being inferior in therapeutic properties to many others
of its class. Mixed with tobacco, the gum was used for smoking at
the court of the Mexican emperors (Humboldt iv. 10). It has long
been used in France as a perfume for gloves, &amp;c. It is mainly
produced in Mexico, little being obtained from trees growing in
higher latitudes of North America, or in England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIQUIDATION<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> making &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; or clear), in law, the
clearing off or settling of a debt. The word was more especially
used in bankruptcy law to define the method by which, under
the Bankruptcy Act 1869, the affairs of an insolvent debtor were
arranged and a composition accepted by his creditors without
actual bankruptcy. It was abolished by the Bankruptcy Act
1883 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bankruptcy</a></span>). In a general sense, liquidation is used
for the act of adjusting debts, as the Egyptian Law of Liquidation,
July 1880, for a general settlement of the liabilities of
Egypt. In company law, liquidation is the winding up and
dissolving a company. The winding up may be either voluntary
or compulsory, and an officer, termed a liquidator, is appointed,
who takes into his custody all the property of the company
and performs such duties as are necessary on its behalf (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Company</a></span>).</p>
